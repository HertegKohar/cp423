''create map , atri team took 3,000 observations exi taken one mars year , period equivalent two years earth , stitched together build color composite . resultant map shows many major geological features red planet high resolution .map reveals polar ice caps , mountains , long inactive volcanoes , well remnants ancient rivers , lakes , valleys around 3.5 billion years ago overflowed liquid water . , map could help planetary scientists better understand climate mars changed billions years resulting dry barren world observe today .`` complete mars map also brings uae arab world another step closer achieving emm 's ambitious mission goal provide complete global picture martian climate , '' atri added . `` 30 previous spacecraft managed capture snapshot mars weather , whilst emm follow seasonal changes throughout martian year . ''allowing scientists study distribution impact craters across planet 's arid surface , map also reveals history early asteroid bombardment mars . composite exi images could also help researchers better understand conditions tumultuous early solar system space rock impacts far common today .hope orbiter first interplanetary mission uae arab world whole . commissioned uae leaders 2014 , spacecraft launched japan july 20 , 2020. journey around seven months , hope reached orbit around mars february 9 , 2021 .`` hope probe helping researchers create global image planet due strategic position , '' atri said . `` hope circles mars elliptical orbit allows observe much away spacecraft . strategic position helping researchers create global image planet .

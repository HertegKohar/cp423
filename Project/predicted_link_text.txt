Moon phases reveal the passage of time in the night sky. Some nights when we look up at the moon, it is full and bright; sometimes it is just a sliver of silvery light. These changes in appearance are the phases of the moon. As the moon orbits Earth, it cycles through eight distinct phases.The four primary phases of the moon occur about a week apart, with the full moon its most dazzling stage.Tariq MalikEditor-in-ChiefTariq is the Editor-in-Chief of Space.com and joined the team in 2001. He covers skywatching, human spaceflight, exploration as well as space science and entertainment, and enjoys observing the moon through a tabletop Celestron telescope when the weather is clear.What's the moon phase tonight?While the moon has four distinct phases each month, it is always changing.As you observe the moon during the month, watch as it grows from a new moon to a first quarter moon. As it grows, it is known as a waxing moon, and gradually increases from a waxing "crescent" (for its shape into the first quarter moon. As it continues to brighten, it takes on an oblong, or "gibbous," shape until it reaches the full moon stage.Then it will repeat the steps in reverse as it heads back to a new moon. You can see what today's moon phase is here with the embedded widget on this page, courtesy of In-The-Sky.org (opens in new tab).If you know someone who can't get enough of the moon, then they'll be delighted with this floating 3D lamp from encalife. Using magnetic levitation technology, the realistic globe will project "moonlight" as it floats and spins in mid-air. Comes in three color modes and wireless LED charging.After the First Quarter moon on March 28, the next moon phase milestone will be the Full Moon on Thursday, April 6, at 12:34 a.m. EDT (0434 GMT). The April Full Moon is known as the Pink Moon.The full moon is the point where the entire face of the moon is illuminated by the sun as seen from Earth."This is as close as we come to seeing the sun's illumination of the entire day side of the moon (so, technically, this would be the real half moon)," NASA wrote (opens in new tab) in its moon guide. "The moon is opposite the sun, as viewed from Earth, revealing the moon's dayside."The full moon actually appears full before it reaches its final phase. It can appear full to the casual observer for a couple of days before and after the actual date."The full moon rises around sunset and sets around sunrise," NASA wrote.The moon, like Earth, is a sphere, and it is always half-illuminated by the sun. As the moon travels around Earth, we see more or less of the illuminated half. Moon phases describe how much of the moon's disk is illuminated from our perspective.New moon: The moon is between Earth and the sun, and the side of the moon facing toward us receives no direct sunlight; it is lit only by dim sunlight reflected from Earth.Waxing crescent: As the moon moves around Earth, the side we can see gradually becomes more illuminated by direct sunlight.First quarter: The moon is 90 degrees away from the sun in the sky and is half-illuminated from our point of view. We call it "first quarter" because the moon has traveled about a quarter of the way around Earth since the new moon.See the moon phases, and the difference between a waxing and waning crescent or gibbous moon, in this Space.com infographic about the lunar cycle each month. See the full infographic. (Image credit: Karl Tate, SPACE.com)Waxing gibbous: The area of illumination continues to increase. More than half of the moon's face appears to be getting sunlight.Full moon: The moon is 180 degrees away from the sun and is as close as it can be to being fully illuminated by the sun from our perspective. The sun, Earth and the moon are aligned, but because the moon’s orbit is not exactly in the same plane as Earth’s orbit around the sun, they rarely form a perfect line. When they do, we have a lunar eclipse as Earth's shadow crosses the moon's face.Waning gibbous: More than half of the moon's face appears to be getting sunlight, but the amount is decreasing.Last quarter: The moon has moved another quarter of the way around Earth, to the third quarter position. The sun's light is now shining on the other half of the visible face of the moon.Waning crescent: Less than half of the moon's face appears to be getting sunlight, and the amount is decreasing.Finally, the moon is back to its new moon starting position. Now, the moon is between Earth and the sun. Usually, the moon passes above or below the sun from our vantage point, but occasionally it passes right in front of the sun, and we get a solar eclipse.Additional moon phase resourcesNASA's SkyCal Events Calendar (opens in new tab) offers a comprehensive calendar of moon phases, lunar and solar eclipses and more for the entire calendar year.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease happens when fat builds up in the liver. Experts say it's hard to say what exactly causes it, but it's associated with poor diet and not enough exercise.Most people experience no symptoms of fatty liver disease — so you may not know you have it.If left untreated, it can lead to more serious liver disease, such as cancer, and land you on a liver transplant wait-list."Your liver has tremendous reserve. Until you're down to about less than 20 per cent, you don't feel anything," said Dr. Eric Yoshida, a professor of medicine at UBC and a hepatologist, a doctor who specializes in the liver.Dr. Alnoor Ramji, a hepatologist and clinical associate professor at UBC, said some patients will complain of a vague sense of discomfort or bloating in the area of the liver, which is just under the right breast."It's not going to be a sharp pain. It doesn't keep them from doing things or activities in any way whatsoever," said Ramji.Does it have anything to do with alcohol?There are two kinds of fatty liver disease: alcoholic and non-alcoholic. The non-alcoholic type affects more people in Canada than the kind associated with alcohol.Ramji said many people diagnosed with fatty liver disease are surprised because they don't drink much."They go, 'How can I possibly have anything wrong with the liver?' It's almost a disbelief that they have a liver disease because they don't consume any significant amount of alcohol," he said.Do more of us have fatty liver disease than in the past?Experts say the rates of fatty liver disease are going up in Canada."Fatty liver disease is now one of the most common indications for a liver transplant, whereas, say, 10 to 20 years ago it was things like hepatitis C," said Yoshida.There are now medications to help cure hepatitis C, so Yoshida said he no longer sees many patients for that disease.Ramji co-authored a modelling study in 2020 that suggested the incidence of fatty liver disease will increase by 20 per cent by 2030."That's driven in the context of Type 2 diabetes as well as obesity, because as those two conditions increase, you expect the fatty liver disease will increase," said Ramji.The modelling study — published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal — also suggested that the number of patients with complications from fatty liver, including cirrhosis, which is scarring and damage of the liver, will double between now and 2030, said Ramji.That means the number of people in Canada with extreme liver damage will go from about 100,000 in 2019 to 200,000 in 2030, he said.There is a lack of national data in Canada on fatty liver, said Ramji, which means most of the data he and other researchers rely on comes from the U.S. or other countries."When we did the modelling data in Canada, we used obesity and diabetes rates available to drive the burden of fatty liver disease and its complications," said Ramji."Hopefully with more interest in this area and thus support, we can better understand the Canadian landscape."WATCH | Dr. Eric Yoshida on the impact of alcohol and liver disease among young peopleDr. Eric Yoshida on the devastating impact of alcohol and liver disease among young people1 year agoDuration 0:34Dr. Eric Yoshida, a professor of medicine at the University of British Columbia and chair of the Canadian Liver Foundation’s Medical Advisory Committee, says patients - particularly younger ones - often express shock and disbelief that alcohol has caused them serious illness.So how do you know if you have fatty liver disease?Experts say most people are diagnosed through blood tests or an ultrasound, often ordered because of an unrelated symptom.In many cases, a family doctor will notice that liver enzymes are higher than normal and will then order an ultrasound, which can confirm the diagnosis, said Dr. Natasha Chandok, a hepatologist at the William Osler Health System in Brampton and an adjunct clinical professor of medicine at McMaster University."What I would tell patients is that if they have risk factors for fatty liver disease that they should see their family doctors to get screening," said Chandok.ABOUT THE AUTHORIsabelle Gallant is an Acadian radio producer and web writer based in P.E.I.

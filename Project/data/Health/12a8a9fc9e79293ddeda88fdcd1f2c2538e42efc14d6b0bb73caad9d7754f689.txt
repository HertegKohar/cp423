considered primary end point mentor teach participants overcome adversity adapt current health status environment . although observe significant changes cd-risc 10 maas scores postprogram , assessing impact mindfulness resilience provides useful information us continue enhancing delivery mentor . also creates new avenues additional evaluations field wellness disability .compared mentor 1.0 , observed larger consistent improvements global wellness assessment ( ie , nwa ) across domains , improvements significant . observed mentor 1.0 , significant increase seen physical activity participants average high baseline glteq scores . however , changes total activity health contribution scores significant participants low baseline glteq scores .another goal mentor 2.0 obtain higher completion rate postprogram assessments . compared current results mentor 1.0 evaluation , observed percentage participants completing postprogram assessments improved 35 % 56 % . used methods achieve . first , reports mentor 1.0 participants questionnaires long , able remove 29 items longest questionnaire ( nutrition , 74 questions originally ) , 38 % reduction , without compromising validity instrument . second , health coaches reminded participants toward end program complete postassessments , noting information would valuable terms identifying made improvements might want continue working post-mentor . third , rehabilitation center partners funded subcontract enroll defined number participants informed requirement participant complete baseline postassessments . finally , health coaches sent reminders healthie portal ( healthie , inc ) last week class complete postassessments .results mentor 2.0 demonstrated significantly higher improvements areas physical , mental , emotional/spiritual health participants average average wellness scores baseline . mentor 1.0 , observed significant changes 2 wellness domains : exercise contribution others . believe improved results may due health coaches becoming knowledgeable program focusing specific wellness domains greater alignment participants ’ needs .one area interest examining data participants low baseline wellness scores . although saw consistent improvements subgroup mentor 1.0 2.0 participants , mentor 2.0 participants slightly better improvements . mentor 1.0 , 1 16 wellness-related questions across participants demonstrated significant gains , 8 16 wellness-related questions participants low nwa baseline scores demonstrated significant gains . conversely , mentor 2.0 , 16 wellness questions demonstrated significant gains .limitationssimilar mentor 1.0 , saw potential ceiling effect offered program participant disability , including already high wellness scores , increasing likelihood ceiling effect several participants . study open anyone identifies mobility disability , whether findings would generalize specific disability group ( eg , multiple sclerosis , parkinson disease ) unclear . another limitation study use nonrandomized , single-group design , limited ability definitively attribute observed changes solely mentor program . however , positive findings warrant investigation , recommend incorporating control group future research using program . findings also generalizable people intellectual disabilities since program adapted population , although plans way begin adapting version mentor . future research program using instruments ceiling effect may provide better results people begin program higher baseline wellness .conclusion future directionspast 20 years , evidence continued grow importance effectiveness noninvasive interventions ( ie , exercise , nutrition , mindfulness ) promotion lifelong health wellness ( 36 ) . scientists expand understanding importance integrative wellness effect multiple physical psychological wellness domains protecting person ’ health , mentor become precise individualized people varying types disabilities .plan follow former mentor participants 1 year reassess health behaviors determine mentor program long-term effects health possibly need assistance . participants sign mentor program , also agree part longitudinal database query health behaviors next 3 5 years . also added online mentor coffee club option post-mentor participants would like continue meeting group discuss popular topics wellness ( eg , diet , mindfulness , art ) .mentor app developed allow participants track individual health behaviors real time 24-hour period provide mentor health coaches access data . acquiring maintaining certain health behaviors dynamic process , necessary participants understand changes health relate changes behavior environment . therefore , getting snapshot person ’ wellness beginning end program may representative day-to-day health behaviors . access participant ’ wellness practices real time allow researchers practitioners address issues occur , better identify gaps

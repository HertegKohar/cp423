designated health workers ipc experience ( i.e. , ipc team ipc focal point ) . accordance guidance core components ipc programs , district national ipc management support facility ipc focal points . example , district- national-level ipc management help ensure availability supplies support good ipc practices , support education training healthcare workforce , provide feedback outcomes . role district national ipc programs especially relevant covid-19 pandemic . settings limited ipc infrastructure , establishing minimum requirements national- facility-level measures protect patients health workers critical .patients suspected covid-19 likely present outpatient facilities . optimizing facility preparedness receive patients covid-19 symptoms help limit exposure risk patients health workers . community transmission sars-cov-2 suspected , facility leadership ipc focal point review ipc guidance operational considerations healthcare facilities follow national ipc guidance prepare facilities safely triage manage patients covid-19 symptoms . consider following measures :infrastructure healthcare workforce ipcdesignate health worker trained ipc ipc focal point , responsible implementing facility ’ covid-19 prevention measures . ipc focal point , collaboration relevant people , coordinate apply various activities facility :communicate local public health authorities understand protocols reporting suspected confirmed covid-19 patients mechanisms request supplies support .determine need supplies hand hygiene , personal protective equipment ( ppe ) , cleaning disinfection , ordering frequency .assess availability hand hygiene supplies ensure supplies readily accessible . alcohol-based hand rubs 60 % 95 % alcohol used healthcare settings . unless hands visibly soiled , alcohol-based hand rub preferred soap water .health worker exposed someone suspected confirmed covid-19 , consult occupational health focal point . based assessment risk factors , health focal point recommend quarantine testing .ensure consistent reporting covid-19 symptoms , health workers could advised report supervisor ( send text message supervisor ) beginning workday review standard list symptoms confirm .review sick leave policies health workers ensure flexible consistent public health guidance encourage health workers ill stay home .establish policies procedures health workers develop symptoms signs covid-19 . example ,health workers become symptomatic work , notify supervisors go home . health workers unable leave work immediately , placed isolation areas able go home .facility ’ ipc focal point supervisor help health workers get tested covid-19 positive tests guide long health workers must excluded work accordance national subnational guidelines . settings limited testing availability , health workers suspected covid-19 tested also excluded work period determined national subnational guidance .modifying outpatient operations important reduce crowding prevent mixing infectious noninfectious patients facilities , prevent transmission sars-cov-2 . coordinating local public health authorities expand strategies available individual facility ( e.g. , identifying alternate care sites essential health services ) . additionally , communities widespread community transmission covid-19 , implementing source control patients , visitors , health workers facilities universal use masks also reduce transmission sars-cov-2 . nonmedical masks recommended general population , medical masks per recommendations prioritized health workers vulnerable populations , including people aged 60 years , underlying conditions , cardiovascular disease , diabetes , chronic lung disease , cancer , cerebrovascular disease , people immunosuppression

transmission outpatient facilities , use alternate care sites non-facility-based models healthcare delivery may considered separate patients need essential health services patients seeking care acute illness . alternate care sites include community-based locations , unoccupied schools stadiums , might temporarily use due local mitigation measures . sites offer benefit space allow appropriate physical distancing health workers patients . however , since sites primarily intended delivery healthcare , structure might suitable outpatient services require physical exams best used deliver single-purpose care ( e.g. , drug pick-ups , immunizations , well-child visits ) . similarly , non-facility-based care , includes outreach services people ’ homes mobile services , help minimize crowding healthcare facilities maintaining essential health services .ipc always needed wherever healthcare delivered , including alternate care sites non-facility-based care . minimum , health workers delivering care settings require education training good ipc practices , including standard transmission-based precautions . patients health workers maintain physical separation least 1 meter others times based recommendations , differ cdc recommendation ≥6 feet ( ≥1.8 meters ) . additional ipc considerations specific situations :alternate care sitesestablish system covid-19 screening triage patients arriving alternate care sites described section b .outreach patients ’ homespractice frequent hand hygiene patient encounter using portable alcohol-based hand rub .consider consultation outside household ensure adequate ventilation .consider wearing medical masks eye protection ( e.g. , face shields goggles ) throughout shift instead changing ppe household , ppe supplies limited .healthcare services require gloves gowns , special considerations needed appropriately put , safely take , dispose ppe .bring visual alerts signs encourage patients take appropriate ipc precautions waiting queues , including maintaining physical distance 1 meter others ( based recommendations , differ cdc recommendation 6 feet [ 1.8 meters ] ) practicing hand hygiene , respiratory hygiene , cough etiquette .clean disinfect commonly touched surfaces vehicle beginning end shift transporting passengers visibly sick . visibly soiled surfaces , use soap water applying disinfectant ( e.g. , alcohol 70 % ) .footnote[ 1 ] near aerosol-generating procedures , recommends health workers providing direct care covid-19 patients wear medical mask ( addition ppe part droplet contact

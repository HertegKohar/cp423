alzheimer ’ disease ( ad ) neurodegenerative disease causes brain cell death . progressive disease , causes distinct pattern pathological changes brain , common among older adults . however , ’ possible adults young 30 experience early-onset alzheimer ’ .people suffer condition may start experiencing mild forgetfulness confusion . disease progresses brain cells die , symptoms become apparent . someone ad may become lost familiar places forget conversations . disease also affect thinking , reasoning , decision-making , cause mood behavioral changes .much progress made ad research , exact cause unknown . although scientists ’ fully understand triggers , factors may contribute disease include genetics lifestyle environmental factors . many scientists also believe buildup two abnormal structures brain play important role . structures called amyloid plaques neurofibrillary tangles .amyloid plaques dense , mostly insoluble clumps protein fragments . leave highly damaging substance outside around brain ’ nerve cells .people ad buildup plaques hippocampus . hippocampus part brain involved memory , including short-term memories stored long-term memories .ability function everyday life affected unhealthy hippocampus . everything involves ability acquire , store , retrieve memories . anything remembering ate lunch , recognizing loved one recalling turned stove .hippocampus also essential spatial memory spatial navigation . spatial memory retain information surroundings . spatial navigation involves travel destination . research suggests early hippocampus damage may explain people ad often wander get lost .neurofibrillary tangles insoluble , twisted fibers clog brain inside .brain nerve cells ( called neurons ) special transport system called microtubules . act like railroad tracks safely guide transport nutrients , molecules , information cells . important fiber-like protein called tau responsible keeping microtubules stable .chemical make-up tau proteins altered people ad . threads tau become tangled twisted . thus , microtubules become unstable disintegrate , collapses entire neuron transport system .series events may related first visible sign ad : memory loss . research needed determine amyloid plaques , tangles , tau direct cause ad .researchers believe genetics play role whether develop ad . elderly , gene associated onset symptoms located chromosome 19. ’ called apolipoprotein e ( apoe ) .several versions ( alleles ) apoe . according national institute aging , 40 percent people develop ad later life apoe e4 allele . blood test determine .said , ’ still possible predict develop ad . people one even two apoe e4 alleles never develop disease . others get ad ’ apoe e4 alleles.still , “ ad gene ” increase risk .one newly identified genes increase risk cd33 . causes body eliminate many amyloid plaques . scientists long believed buildup amyloid plaques likely plays key role degradation brain neurons .genetic studies families history early-onset ad identified mutations three different genes .app ( chromosome 21 )psen1 ( chromosome 14 )psen2 ( chromosome 1 )genes thought responsible rare form ad afflicts men women early 30s 40s . mutations believed help produce amyloid protein , forms amyloid plaques . mutated genes play role common late-onset ad .approximately 50 percent people parent early-onset ad likely inherit genetic mutation develop disease . young individuals neither parent early-onset ad , research found often second-degree relative ( e.g. , uncle , aunt , grandparent ) suffered condition .although ’ cure ad , treatment improve cognitive behavioral symptoms . ’ definitive way prevent ad , maintaining healthy lifestyle may reduce risk . includes :eating healthy dietlosing excess weightquitting smokinggetting regular physical activity ( 150 minutes per week )adding foods omega-3 fats , salmon , diet taking fish oil supplementsgetting plenty sleepsocially activebrain puzzles mental exercises also improve cognitive function lower risk .q :anything prevent developing amyloid plaques neurofibrillary tangles ?anonymous patient:thus far , scientists certain deposition amyloid plaques neurofibrillary tangles come disease cause disease . best advice offer maintain good overall health . includes eating well exercising . research suggests cognitively active engaging mentally stimulating activities may also help .timothy j. legg , phd , crnpanswers represent opinions medical experts . content strictly informational considered medical advice .helpful ?last medically reviewed december 19 , 2016reviewed article :healthline strict sourcing guidelines relies peer-reviewed studies , academic research institutions , medical associations . avoid using tertiary references . learn ensure content accurate current reading editorial policy .

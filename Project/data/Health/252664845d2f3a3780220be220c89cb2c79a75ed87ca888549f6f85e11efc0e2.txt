processes44 implementation science principles45 promote uptake intervention . additionally , hospital sepsis programs monitor use effectiveness hospital interventions refine interventions needed optimize treatment outcomes .priority examples action include :implementing standardized process screen sepsis : early administration sepsis treatment lifesaving,46-50 important clinicians recognize sepsis early possible . end , hospitals standardized process screen at-risk patients sepsis upon presentation hospital throughout hospitalization . screening may use paper-based electronic health record-based tools may occur standard recurring intervals ( e.g. , every 8-12 hours ) and/or response clinical events ( e.g. , upon icu transfer , upon clinical deterioration ) . given variety clinical decision support systems use low quality studies evaluating impact , optimal approach screening sepsis remains unclear.25,27 indeed , 2021 surviving sepsis campaign guidelines include strong recommendation hospital sepsis programs process screen sepsis , recommend specific tool approach.18,19 regardless method chosen , screening sepsis implemented according user-centered design principles tailored specific patient population served ( e.g. , adult , pediatric , obstetric ) . screening integrated clinical workflow way enhances recognition sepsis , minimizing false-positive alarms alarms patients already recognized sepsis . furthermore , newer , complex screening tools using machine learning artificial intelligence analyzed ensure project bias patient race , ethnicity , gender , characteristics .examples hospital screening tools available resources page .developing maintaining hospital guideline standardized care pathway management sepsis : hospital guidelines standardized care pathways greatly enhance effectiveness sepsis programs establishing clear recommendations care . ideally , guidelines address management across continuum hospital care including screening , clinical evaluation ( e.g. , recommended/suggested laboratory , microbiology , laboratory , imaging studies ) , diagnosis , antimicrobial selection , source control , fluid resuscitation ( e.g. , indications , contraindications , type , volume fluid ) , indications treatment escalation ( e.g. , admission critical care unit ) , antimicrobial narrowing , antimicrobial stopping , patient family/caregiver education sepsis , peri-discharge management . recommendations based published guidelines generally accepted standards care , also take consideration available resources , local epidemiology , patient population served ( e.g. , adult , pediatric , obstetric ) . example , international/national guidelines recommend prompt antimicrobials source control , hospital guidelines provide guidance selection antimicrobials based local resistance patterns antimicrobial formulary options guidance approaching source control based hospital availability surgical interventional radiology services . empiric antimicrobial options recommended conjunction antimicrobial stewardship infectious diseases staff . ensure viability hospital guidelines , updated least biannually based existing evidence-based sepsis guidelines .examples hospital guidelines and/or clinical pathways addressing sepsis management available resources page .hospital order sets management sepsis : templated order sets aid implementation recommended practices sepsis evaluation management , including selection antimicrobial therapy , timely delivery first dose antimicrobials , clinical evaluation , source control , fluid resuscitation , antimicrobial narrowing , antimicrobial stopping . order sets tailored specific patient population ( e.g. , pediatric versus adult patients ) . hospital screening sepsis , content scope sepsis order sets may vary across hospitals , always developed user-centered design principles . easier order appropriate sepsis evaluation treatment , likely order set used clinicians .structures processes facilitate prompt delivery antimicrobials : timely delivery antimicrobial therapy sepsis life-saving.46-48 addition facilitating prompt recognition sepsis , hospitals facilitate prompt administration initial antimicrobial therapy order antimicrobial therapy placed.51 estimated one-third interval patient presentation antimicrobial delivery occurs antimicrobial order , post-order delays associated increased mortality.52 furthermore , concern efforts hasten recognition sepsis antimicrobial ordering may increase unnecessary antimicrobial prescribing , efforts shorten time antimicrobial order delivery carry risk.51 many processes hospitals may use shorten time antimicrobial order antimicrobial delivery,51 including , limited , examples :stocking common antimicrobials locations outside pharmacy , ed , icu , hospital wards .immediate processing new antimicrobial orders patients sepsis .clinician order entry systems default immediate administration new antimicrobials ( opposed next standard medication administration time ) .pharmacists on-site key locations outside pharmacy , ed icu .structures processes support effective hospital hand-offs patients sepsis : transfers units ( e.g. , ed-to-ward , ward-to-icu , icu-to-ward transfers ) , treating clinicians ( e.g. , physician nursing shift changes ) , hospitals high-risk times information loss . incomplete awareness patient ’ working diagnosis , uncertainty regarding diagnosis , and/or treatment-to-date contribute lapses delivery subsequent care . example , delays first-to-second antimicrobial dose sepsis common associated worse outcomes.53,54 structured communication processes hand-off key information transitions care consistently associated reduced errors improved outcomes . hospitals prioritize procedures , templated notes document sepsis diagnosis treatment information , help ensure effective transitions care within hospital . hospitals also processes safe patient transfer healthcare facilities continue plan care facilitate infection control , akin inter-facility infection control transfer form.55additional examples action include :rapid response teams trained sepsis recognition care : rapid response teams ( also known medical emergency teams ) first developed 1990s bring needed expertise bedside patients experiencing acute clinical deterioration . sepsis rapid response teams rapid response teams specifically focused managing patients sepsis.56,56 teams often multi-disciplinary , consisting nurses , physicians , respiratory therapists , pharmacists , phlebotomists . implementation sepsis-specific rapid response teams training general rapid response teams management sepsis associated improved care practices.57“ code sepsis ” protocol : many hospitals use “ code sepsis ” huddles hasten sepsis recognition treatment.58-60 “ code sepsis ” activated clinical staff based suspicion sepsis , often response vital signs chief complaint upon presentation ed . code sepsis activation triggers multi-disciplinary team huddle ( e.g. , physician physician assistant , primary nurse , ed pharmacist , ed charge nurse ) patient ’ bedside evaluation clinical scenario initiation expedited early sepsis treatment ( e.g. , cultures , lactate measurement , imaging , antimicrobials , fluid ) indicated . implementation code sepsis protocol associated increased recognition sepsis faster delivery initial treatment.58-60 time , studies suggested “ code sepsis ” may also increase delivery antimicrobials patients ultimately turn non-infectious non-bacterial causes , particularly “ code sepsis ” protocols based prior systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( sirs ) -based sepsis definition.61,62 large , multi-hospital study showed feasible shorten time-to-antibiotics among patients sepsis simultaneously improving antimicrobial stewardship among patients at-risk sepsis.42 however , still possible efforts hasten sepsis treatment may increase unnecessary antimicrobial . definitive confirmation infection rarely possible real-time , decisions initiate antimicrobial therapy must often precede confirmation infection.63 given challenges , “ code sepsis ” protocols must designed carefully , include iterative reassessment stopping antimicrobials alternative non-infection-related diagnosis found , evaluated understand impact .peri-discharge evaluation : survivors hospitalization sepsis may experience new worsening functional limitations , cognitive impairment , post-traumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) /anxiety symptoms , chronic health conditions.7 40 % patients re-hospitalized within three months discharge.64 common causes re-hospitalization include recurrent infection , heart failure exacerbation , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) exacerbation , acute renal failure , aspiration pneumonitis.64 hospitalizations may preventable optimal medical management.64 following practices

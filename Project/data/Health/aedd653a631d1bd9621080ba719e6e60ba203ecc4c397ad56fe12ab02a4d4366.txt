xbb.1.5 highly transmissible immune evasive rapidly spread 25 countries .know omicron xbb.1.5lauren vogel | january 6 , 2023omicron subvariant xbb.1.5 rapidly spreading united states europe transmissible sars-cov-2 strain date , according world health organization . meanwhile , concerning surge covid-19 china appears driven subvariants ba.5.2 bf.7 .“ really concerned current covid-19 epidemiological picture , intense transmission several parts world recombinant subvariant spreading quickly , ” said director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus news conference .xbb.1.5 ?xbb.1.5 first detected united states october , quickly overtaken circulating strains . subvariant evolved xbb , recombinant fusion two omicron variants , spread widely singapore india past fall .xbb.1.5 accounts 40 % new covid-19 cases u.s. , including 75 % northeast country , 1.3 % month ago . hospitalizations also trending upward , although ’ still unclear much ’ related new subvariant versus recent holidays .“ ’ seen variant ’ taken speed , ” pavitra roychoudhury , director covid-19 sequencing university washington school medicine ’ virology lab , told cnn .xbb.1.5 since identified 25 countries , including canada . mid-december , federal government identified xbb.1.5 0.6 % thousand genomic tests conducted across country .however , covid-19 testing dropped jurisdictions , ’ difficult chart spread new subvariant .early january , british columbia centre disease control detected least five cases xbb.1.5 , health ministries alberta , manitoba , ontario unable say whether subvariant circulating provinces .data xbb.1.5 limited , world health organization says new subvariant appears marked “ growth advantage ” making transmissible circulating strains sars-cov-2 .xbb mutation helped evade immunity hampered ability infect cells , xbb.1.5 evolved bind tightly cells continuing dodge body ’ immune defences , allowing spread easily .american scientists estimate every person infected xbb.1.5 pass 1.6 people – effective reproductive rate ’ roughly 40 % higher next contagious variant .newer omicron variants also attach cells upper airways versus deeply lungs , meaning virus ’ need travel far cause infection , according b.c . provincial health officer bonnie henry .xbb.1.5 dangerous ?like united states , b.c . seen recent uptick hospitalizations due covid-19 , henry told reporters due people infected rather virulent strain .far , xbb sublineages ’ appear cause severe disease omicron variants . transmissible immune evasive strain , xbb.1.5 could still drive increases hospitalizations deaths people overall infected reinfected .vaccines treatments work xbb.1.5 ?early research suggests xbb sublineages immune evasive variants , undercutting protection provided vaccines , past infections , antibody treatments .one small study 35 people published new england journal medicine , neutralizing antibody levels newer omicron subvariants including xbb 12 26 times lower original strain sars-cov-2 people received bivalent booster . however , bivalent booster still appeared offer benefit , neutralizing activity even lower people received updated vaccine .another recent study , researchers columbia university tested bq xbb subvariants 23 monoclonal antibody treatments , well antibodies people previously covid-19 , received original bivalent vaccines , previously infected vaccinated .results , published cell , showed bq xbb subvariants “ completely resistant ” current monoclonal antibody treatments demonstrate dramatically increased ability evade neutralizing antibodies , even people received bivalent mrna booster .xbb.1 particularly showed alarming levels immune evasion , according study lead david ho . subvariant 49 63 times less likely neutralized antibodies blood previously infected vaccinated people compared older strains – xbb.1.5 evasive , ho told cnn .even , bivalent vaccine still provides protection serious illness death . “ recent data show bivalent vaccine , threefold lower risk dying ’ , ” ho said .although monoclonal antibody treatments longer effective new omicron subvariants , antiviral treatments paxlovid remdesivir still work .meanwhile , wider use rapid tests masks , well better ventilation air filtration public indoor settings , could help reduce risk transmission .“ measures ’ going need take long term . variant next one come , good position , ” infectious disease specialist brian conway told cbc news .

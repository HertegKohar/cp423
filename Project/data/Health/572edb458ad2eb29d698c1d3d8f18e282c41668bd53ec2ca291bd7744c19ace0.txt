kidneys pair fist-sized organs located bottom rib cage . one kidney side spine .kidneys essential healthy body . mainly responsible filtering waste products , excess water , impurities blood . toxins stored bladder removed urination .kidneys also regulate ph , salt , potassium levels body . produce hormones regulate blood pressure control production red blood cells . kidneys even activate form vitamin helps body absorb calcium .kidney disease affects approximately 37 million american adults . occurs kidneys become damaged perform function . damage may caused diabetes , high blood pressure , various long-term ( chronic ) conditions .kidney disease lead health problems , including weak bones , nerve damage , malnutrition .disease gets worse time , kidneys may stop working completely . means dialysis required perform function kidneys . dialysis treatment filters purifies blood using machine . cure kidney disease , prolong life .chronic kidney diseasecommon form kidney disease chronic kidney disease . chronic kidney disease long-term condition improve time . ’ commonly caused high blood pressure .high blood pressure dangerous kidneys increase pressure glomeruli . glomeruli tiny blood vessels kidneys blood cleaned . time , increased pressure damages vessels , kidney function begins decline .kidney function eventually deteriorate point kidneys longer perform job properly . case , person would need go dialysis . dialysis filters extra fluid waste blood . dialysis help treat kidney disease , cure .diabetes also major cause chronic kidney disease . diabetes group diseases causes high blood sugar . increased level sugar blood damages blood vessels kidneys time . means kidneys clean blood properly . kidney failure occur body becomes overloaded toxins .kidney stoneskidney stones another common kidney problem . occur minerals substances blood crystallize kidneys , forming solid masses ( stones ) . kidney stones usually come body urination . passing kidney stones extremely painful , rarely cause significant problems .glomerulonephritisglomerulonephritis inflammation glomeruli . glomeruli extremely small structures inside kidneys filter blood . glomerulonephritis caused infections , drugs , disorders occur shortly birth ( congenital abnormalities ) . often gets better .polycystic kidney diseasepolycystic kidney disease genetic disorder causes numerous cysts ( small sacs fluid ) grow kidneys . cysts interfere kidney function cause kidney failure .’ important note individual kidney cysts fairly common almost always harmless . polycystic kidney disease separate , serious condition .urinary tract infectionsurinary tract infections ( utis ) bacterial infections part urinary system . infections bladder urethra common . easily treatable rarely lead health problems . however , left untreated , infections spread kidneys cause kidney failure .people diabetes higher risk developing kidney disease . diabetes leading cause kidney disease , accounting 44 percent new cases . may also likely get kidney disease :high blood pressurefamily members chronic kidney diseaseelderlyresearch indicates kidney disease occurs often people african american , hispanic , asian , american indian descent .doctor first determine whether higher risk developing kidney disease . run tests see kidneys functioning properly . tests may include :glomerular filtration rate ( gfr )test measure well kidneys working determine stage kidney disease .ultrasound computed tomography ( ct ) scanultrasounds ct scans produce clear images kidneys urinary tract . pictures allow doctor see kidneys small large . also show tumors structural problems may present .kidney biopsykidney biopsy , doctor remove small piece tissue kidney ’ sedated . tissue sample help doctor determine type kidney disease much damage occurred .urine testdoctor may request urine sample test albumin . albumin protein passed urine kidneys damaged .blood creatinine testcreatinine waste product . ’ released blood creatine ( molecule stored muscle ) broken . levels creatinine blood increase kidneys ’ working properly .treatment kidney disease usually focuses controlling underlying cause disease . means doctor help better manage blood pressure , blood sugar , cholesterol levels . may use one following methods treat kidney disease .drugs medicationdoctor either prescribe angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ace ) inhibitors , lisinopril ramipril , angiotensin receptor blockers ( arbs ) , irbesartan olmesartan . blood pressure medications slow progression kidney disease .doctor may prescribe medications preserve kidney function , even ’ high blood pressure .may also treated cholesterol drugs ( simvastatin ) . medications reduce blood cholesterol levels help maintain kidney health . depending symptoms , doctor may also prescribe drugs relieve swelling treat anemia ( decrease number red blood cells ) .dietary lifestyle changesmaking changes diet important taking medication . adopting lifestyle health-promoting benefits help prevent many underlying causes kidney disease . doctor may recommend :dialysis artificial method filtering blood . ’ used kidneys failed close failing . many people late-stage kidney disease must go dialysis permanently donor kidney found .two types dialysis : hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis .hemodialysishemodialysis , blood pumped special machine filters waste products fluid . hemodialysis done home hospital dialysis center . people three sessions per week , session lasting 3 5 hours . however , hemodialysis also done shorter , frequent sessions .several weeks starting hemodialysis , people surgery create arteriovenous ( av ) fistula . av fistula created connecting artery vein skin , typically forearm . larger blood vessel allows increased amount blood flow continuously body hemodialysis treatment .means blood filtered purified . arteriovenous graft ( looped , plastic tube ) may implanted used purpose artery vein joined together .common side effects hemodialysis low blood pressure , muscle cramping , itching .peritoneal dialysisperitoneal dialysis , peritoneum ( membrane lines abdominal wall ) stands kidneys . tube implanted used fill abdomen fluid called dialysate . waste products blood flow peritoneum dialysate . dialysate drained abdomen .two forms peritoneal dialysis : continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis , abdomen filled drained several times day , continuous cycler-assisted peritoneal dialysis , uses machine cycle fluid abdomen night person sleeps .common side effects peritoneal dialysis infections abdominal cavity area tube implanted . side effects may include weight gain hernias . hernia intestine pushes weak spot tear lower abdominal wall .kidney disease normally go away ’ diagnosed . best way maintain kidney health adopt lifestyle health-promoting benefits follow doctor ’ advice . kidney disease get worse time . may even lead kidney failure . kidney failure life threatening left untreated .kidney failure occurs kidneys barely working working . dialysis artificial process manage function kidneys . dialysis involves use machine filter waste blood . cases , doctor may recommend kidney transplant .non-modifiable risk factors kidney disease — age family history — controlled . also , control ethnicity , research shows indicator ’ higher risk developing kidney disease .however , measures take help prevent kidney disease :drink plenty watermanage blood sugar diabetesmanage blood pressurereduce salt intakequit smoking smokecareful over-the-counter drugsalways follow dosage instructions over-the-counter medications . taking much aspirin ( bayer ) ibuprofen ( advil , motrin ) cause kidney damage . call doctor normal doses medications managing pain effectively .get testedask doctor getting blood test kidney problems . kidney problems generally ’ cause symptoms ’ advanced . basic metabolic panel ( bmp ) standard blood test done part routine medical exam .checks blood creatinine urea . chemicals leak blood kidneys working properly . bmp detect kidney problems early , ’ easier treat .tested annually :diabetesheart

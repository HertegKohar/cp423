4 stages progression rheumatoid arthritisfour stages rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) also known early-stage ra , moderate-stage ra , severe ra , end-stage ra . symptoms may appear moderate-stage ra , stage 2 .rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) mild , moderate , severe , symptoms vary person person .’ exact timeline progression ra . without effective treatment , condition tends worsen time , progressing specific stages .many new treatments effective slowing ra disease progression . treatment slows progression ra , help manage disease effectively take care health .ra progresses , body changes . changes see feel , others . stage ra comes different treatment goals .stage 1stage 1 early-stage ra . many people feel joint pain , stiffness , swelling . stage 1 , ’ inflammation inside joint . tissue joint swells . example , stage 1 ra hands , person may feel stiffness pain finger joints knuckles . sensations usually disappear movement .tissue joint swells , ’ damage bones , joint lining ( synovium ) inflamed .symptoms obvious stage , people develop ra may aware initially , doctors may find difficult diagnose stage .however , doctor diagnoses disease person receives appropriate treatment within 12 weeks , good chance disease may go remission .stage 2stage 2 moderate-stage ra . stage , synovium ’ inflammation causes damage joint cartilage bone . cartilage tissue covers end bones joint site . bone next cartilage ends joint first area experiences damage due ra .people cartilage damage , may experience pain loss mobility . range motion joints may become limited . example , ra hands may show form stiffness difficulty bending fingers .despite symptoms , blood tests may show sign ra antibodies stage . ra antibodies may negative small subset people ra may remain zero-negative . common progression ra antibodies present years symptoms develop . known zero-negative ra .stage 3ra progresses stage 3 , experts consider severe . point , damage extends cartilage , bone destruction progresses . since cushion bones wears away , bones rub together .may pain swelling . people may experience muscle weakness mobility loss .bones experience damage ( erosion ) , changes formation may occur . examples , may permanent , include twisted fingers thickened knuckles . symptoms may include compressed tendons wrist , symptoms carpal tunnel syndrome tendon rupture .rupture extensor tendons fingers due synovitis wrist major risk , doctors prevent identify early .stage 4stage 4 , ’ longer inflammation joint . end-stage ra , joints longer work .end-stage ra , people may still experience pain , swelling , stiffness , mobility loss . may lower muscle strength . joints may experience destruction , bones may fuse ( ankylosis ) .depending progression location

.johns hopkins arthritis center notes usual course ra progression includes flare-ups high disease activity . time , flare-ups become lengthier challenging .another common pattern occurs people experience strong attacks early stages ra , followed periods minimal disease activity .less 10 % people ra fall spontaneous remission within first 6 months onset symptoms . remission ra precise medical definition .general , means ra disease activity stops . people ra demonstrate disease markers anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody rheumatoid factor greater chance remission .remission ra involves periods little disease activity , sometimes ra-related antibodies blood tests . period lasts months , experts consider sustained remission .frequency sustained remission ra low , ’

reality climate change imperative sharply reduce greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions addressed policymakers many countries , potential transform underpinnings north american global economy .e-brief examines us climate policy industrial policy inflation reduction act , assesses coverage potential impacts , provides preliminary assessment canadian federal government ’ response , recently 2023 budget .makes argument canada responded large-scale relatively targeted way maintains level playing field two countries certain types clean investment , clean finance .policy developments reduce emissions likely among canada ’ main trading partners , potentially pulling investment away canada . canada need vigilant initiatives green supply-chain products treated equivalent emerging policies . carbon pricing , preference matching others ’ subsidies , remain centerpiece canada ’ emissions-reduction strategy .inflation reduction act ( ira ) exceptionally broad piece us federal legislation designed accomplish numerous goals simultaneously . signed law president biden august 2022. notwithstanding politically clever name ( reflects parts vast legislation ) , centerpiece ira forming comprehensive framework us climate industrial policy providing incentives invest produce domestic energy sources low ghg emissions ( “ clean energy ” short ) promote clean energy use .act represents significant initiative us far address climate change . law authorized massive spending low-carbon energy activities designed reduce ghg emissions . result , us greenhouse gas emissions 2030 projected reduced 40 percent 2005 levels , line us commitments date.1study , focus specific ira programs support investment , production use clean energy , foundational reducing ghg emissions . building federal green financing capacity also key enabler ira.2ira contains numerous tax credit programs targeted facilitating investment production energy low ghg emissions . includes tax credits new clean hydrogen , nuclear power , renewable electricity , new “ clean ” electricity fuel , sustainable aviation fuel , biofuel , biodiesel , renewable diesel . direct fiscal support also provided offshore wind production .specifically , new tech-neutral clean electricity investment tax credit established replace another existing credit phasing end 2024. credit 30 percent provided investments year facility put service . bonus 10 20 percent available meeting domestic manufacturing requirements steel , iron , manufactured components , projects located brownfield sites , often called “ energy communities , ” low-income disadvantaged communities .new tech-neutral tax credit clean electricity production also established . credit 1.5 cents per kwh electricity produced zero negative ghg emissions sold stored facilities placed service 2024. carbon capture , utilization , storage used reach qualifying emissions levels bonuses 10 20 percent available , conditions clean energy investment tax credit .another new tax credit provided production clean energy technology components us territorial us possession . eligible items include components solar , wind turbine offshore wind equipment , inverters,3 many battery components , critical minerals needed produce items . ira also extends expands tax credit carbon capture sequestration , including direct air capture , commits funding federal investment low-emission materials buildings , well federal funds investment biomass , carbon removal , forest management .one facility might conceivably able access four different tax incentives producing electricity net-zero emissions : investment new facility , clean technology used facility , including carbon capture technology reduces emissions zero , ongoing clean electricity production . practice , however , expected facility need choose investment production tax credits , limiting cascading effect .ira maintains existing $ 7,500 consumer credit4 purchase qualified new clean personal vehicle , includes electric vehicles , plug-in hybrids , hydrogen fuel cell vehicles , end date . credit available maximum purchase price $ 80,000 vans , suvs pickups , $ 55,000 vehicles . smaller tax credit also provided purchase previously owned clean non-commercial vehicles .new vehicle tax credit reduced eliminated specified share critical minerals utilized battery components extracted processed us member countries cusma ( canada mexico ) , recycled north america . share rises steeply 40 percent 2024 80 percent 2026. credit also reduced eliminated ev assembled north america , battery components sourced north america .green commercial vehicles eligible tax credits . $ 7,500 tax credit available class 1-3 vehicles ( 14,000 lbs . ) , increasing $ 40,000 class 4 vehicles ( 14,000 lbs. ) . furthermore , $ 1 billion subsidy program available states local governments clean school buses garbage trucks , presumably could make use tax credit program .incentivize ghg reduction private residences , ira includes : tax credits residential clean energy energy-efficiency improvements homes ; rebates whole-house energy saving retrofits ; grants contractor training energy efficiency .ira implicitly assumes financial market gaps green energy investment low-carbon transformation , absence policy measures , would mean inadequate market-based financing energy low-carbon industrial transition . gaps reflect combination uncertainty risks related new low-emission technologies processes , investor lender inexperience , lack uniform standards clean financing . address market failure , ira secures significant new federal government lending authority totalling $ 290 billion , well budgetary funding $ 33 billion credit subsidies grants . massive increase lending authority subsidies made available via various programs administered us department energy epa .ira energy climate provisions heavily interventionist , guided much perceived ability secure ira ’ passage congress economic climate analysis . tax credits provided clean energy investment production , facilities might potentially able benefit cascading credits . ira also important social policy dimension providing funding disadvantaged communities many policy areas .ira relies heavily fiscal instruments encourage shift consumer behaviour business decisions . introduce market-based mechanisms , i.e. , nationwide carbon pricing . thirteen us states covering third national gdp form carbon pricing ( centre climate energy solutions 2021 ) , result uneven patchwork significant coverage gaps inconsistencies . available economic literature clearly indicates price signals , influenced carbon price , economically efficient transparent way encourage transition low-carbon economy . carbon pricing becomes embedded purchase production decisions throughout economy takes advantage market forces already work ( kennedy 2019 , p.11 ) . however , politically unpopular provides highly visible target opponents .choice evidently made early political process include carbon pricing ira framework . still possible ira ’ subsidy-based actions achieve overall policy goal reducing ghg emissions , less transparency , higher fiscal cost , likely economic cost well terms forgone gdp due efficiency losses .ira wide-ranging terms taking steps reduce us ghg emissions across nine categories covered , necessarily comprehensive . necessary low-carbon transition emissions-intensive sectors , petrochemicals , cement , steel , areas emissions-intensive manufacturing , generally supported subsidies , although tax credits provided carbon capture storage could used across many sectors . funding provided nature-based solutions , restoring preserving forests , prairies wetlands , could help reduce overall stock emissions .terms clean energy consumption adaptation , reducing emissions vehicles housing addressed limited subsidy support investment would reduce emissions commercial institutional buildings . funding provided contractor training energy efficiency , workforce adjustment . also unclear climate resilience built existing new infrastructure ; funding infrastructure provided separate legislation profiled ira .ira climate-action package expensive , estimated nearly $ 400 billion congressional budget office ( cbo ) . many specific initiatives ira uncapped tax credits budget limit written law . credits expire decade longer many cases , actual potential costs ira climate package essentially open-ended . alternative estimates private sector suggest ira climate-action spending exceed $ 800 billion could high $ 1.3 trillion , three times cbo projection .analysts asserted ira profound effect across industries next decade could ultimately reshape direction american economy ( mayer 2022 ) . said , consensus act ’ growth , jobs fiscal impacts , although general agreement ira would likely negligible impact inflation .canada mexico feared exports us might included legislation ; concerns appear addressed text making firms cusma area eligible benefit various subsidies . however , remains competitive threat arbitrary us trade action , particularly production supply chains rely heavily inputs imported beyond cusma area . eu , japan , korea others issues access ira subsidies relevant exports us . advocating recognition exports legislation ; , could take case world trade organization ( wto ) implement retaliatory tariffs ( busch 2021 ) .trade conflicts related climate policy avoided , us , eu others ought collaborate long-term measures better define relationship climate trade policy ( jackson 2022 , p.2. ) . carbon border adjustment specific area discussion closer alignment priority , particularly since eu introduced carbon border adjustment mechanism eu importers required pay carbon price imports countries less stringent regulations match carbon price comparable eu products , including steel , cement , fertiliser , aluminum electricity .ira wide-ranging necessarily comprehensive authorizing actions reduce us ghg emissions . relies largely fiscal instruments shift consumer behaviour business decisions reduce emissions , ignoring market-based mechanisms like carbon pricing . fiscal cost likely much higher first estimated , could challenges legislation ’ compliance rules international trading system .nevertheless , ira encourage america shift energy investment , production use toward lower emissions . expected us competitive positioning enhanced forms energy production technology , including solar wind , hydrogen , carbon capture storage , wind turbines , clean energy storage .federal government clearly aware potential competitive threats arising ira . reasonable policy goal seek level competitive playing field priority areas like clean investment access clean finance .discussed earlier , ira relies heavily expensive fiscal tools introduce national market-based mechanisms like carbon pricing . contrast , canada comprehensive carbon pricing framework already place , help shift consumer business behaviour reduce ghg emissions much lower fiscal likely economic cost using extensive subsidies grants . sufficient carbon pricing effective substitute tax credits number areas , notably influencing energy consumption consumers businesses reducing emissions vehicles , built structures , production processes .carbon pricing generally seen economically efficient less harmful growth climate policy options . canada ’ ecofiscal commission undertook model-based research estimated average annual growth canada 2020 2030 would 1.61 percent using carbon pricing meet canadian emission goals , slightly lower current estimates canadian economy ’ growth potential 1.7 percent . comparison , estimated annual growth 1.37 percent lower climate policy scenarios combined regulations subsidies ( ecofiscal , p.32 ) .government support clean finance address market failure , fill specific market gaps , help mobilize private capital priority investments . one caveat : important parallel ensure adequate current projected demand given clean product service ( popp 2016 ) . ira makes significant new clean-finance capacity available us government entities , could tilt playing field clean investment north america advantage . restore competitive balance , canada take steps provide government-backed green finance , committed ( fes 2022 ) . area innovation applied canada make expanded clean finance available multiple channels , notably federal crown financial institutions canada infrastructure bank ( cib ) , business development bank canada ( bdc ) export development canada ( edc ) .ira wide-ranging , outlining action across nine categories covered act . canadian governments selective targeted addressing competitiveness issues . compelling competitive reason provide subsidies energy use vehicles , housing commercial buildings , especially pan-canadian carbon pricing framework ( revenue recycling ) already place . instead , focus could fall securing clean investment seeking ensure canada gets share north american industrial energy production aimed reducing eliminating emissions , commensurate capabilities .ira provides technology-neutral tax credits investment , production , array energy sources . investment could shift canada us clean energy sources including clean hydrogen , zero-emission electricity , sustainable aviation fuel , biofuel , biodiesel , renewable diesel , impact long-term canadian production exporting capacity . core approach , would make sense adopt technology-neutral approach tax credits subsidies canada .guarantees providing tax credits fiscal support level investment playing field us . clean investment may still flow south border underlying economic system , recurring protectionist pressures , uncertainties respect pathway green policies . thus , fiscal cost tax credits may produce expected economic benefits innovative clean technologies . yet without absorbing fiscal costs , would hard canada respond us subsidies contained ira .responding competitive challenge ira federal policy issue . electricity production largely provincial jurisdiction supervision ; many provinces ( municipalities cases ) given province ’ capacity electricity production , transmission distribution . meet emissions targets , provinces already pursuing investment electricity industrial production low ghg emissions engaging carbon management . better dialogue , coordination shared support investment across canadian jurisdictions would help addressing competitiveness challenges us .certain climate-related fiscal “ payments ” made budget 2022 2022 fall economic statement ( fes 2022 ) helped offset initiatives ira . budget 2022 measures related climate policy reduced emissions included :new refundable investment tax credit carbon capture , utilization , storage , direct air capture also eligible ;proposal create new tax credit 30 percent investments clean technology , focused net-zero technologies , battery storage solutions , clean hydrogen ;extending incentives zero-emission vehicle purchases march 2025 , financing build national network electric vehicle charging stations .subsequent 2022 fall economic statement ( fes ) emphasized government committed taking action provide level playing field canada united states . fes announced :launch canada growth fund , intended help attract new private capital support canada ’ low-carbon economic transformation . fund would offset risks unlock private capital , using tools like debt financing , equity contracts help provide predictable environment decision-making long-term investments .confirmation refundable tax credit made available budget 2023 equal 30 percent capital cost clean-tech investments .investment tax credit support investments clean hydrogen production based lifecycle carbon intensity hydrogen .commitment announce new measures maintain competitiveness clean technology manufacturing .canada need match ira across board . canada continue apply selective strategy simultaneously reduce emissions , address competitiveness issues support low- zero-emission economic growth – including areas like clean energy investment , development clean tech related supply chains , key enablers like green finance . fiscal resources focused , matching ira subsidy approach required .help determine measures pursue , propose six key objectives canadian low-carbon transition aimed maximizing economic benefits utilizing right policy tools right place .objective 1 : promote clean investment . top priority , canada focus measures foster investment clean energy , clean tech strategic inputs commensurate canada ’ comparative advantages , minimizing deflection investment us .objective 2 : maintain us market access clean exports . canadian efforts maintain us market access clean exports far successful .objective 4 : use best policy option . ira implement us carbon pricing , even though economically efficient , transparent much less costly subsidies . detailed pan-canadian carbon pricing framework already place , continue centrepiece canadian climate policy .objective 5 : engage provinces . provinces primacy electricity production in-province transmission distribution ; areas federal primacy leadership , trans-border energy transmission ; responsibility shared areas , specific industrial sectors .drawing objectives , proposed budget 2023 focus three key elements ( hodgson 2023b ) :first , broaden tax credits promote technology-neutral investment clean fuels clean tech . available across value chain , notably key inputs vehicle batteries components . since electricity production largely provincial jurisdiction , ottawa ready engage provinces sharing cost tax credits investment innovative zero-emission electricity .second , double $ 30 billion clean finance capacity canada growth fund enhance clean finance crown financial institutions . merits federal green bank could also considered .third , spend selectively reduce emissions position canadian suppliers . smart procurement spending , federal government use purchasing power reduce emissions position domestic suppliers growth ( hodgson , march 2023 ) .budget 2023 , released march 28 , contains selective initiatives aimed ensuring competitive balance ira certain areas promoting low-carbon transition . federal action broadly aligned advice , although important differences detail . highlights include :15 percent refundable tax credit eligible investments non-emitting electricity generation systems , abated natural gas-fired electricity generation , stationary electricity storage systems , equipment interprovincial electricity transmission . provinces territories engaged design tax credit credit ’ level depend meeting labour requirements , new feature canadian tax policy mirrors approach used ira . tax credit accelerate electrification canadian economy creates potential expanded exports zero-emission electricity us . means federal intervention space largely provincial – expect provinces utilities happy take tax credit . knowledge , first time tax credits sort extended public utilities , setting another precedent . overall fiscal cost significant , projected $ 25.7 billion 2034-35 .30 percent refundable tax credit investments new machinery equipment used manufacture process key clean technologies , extract , process , recycle key critical minerals . tax credit position canadian manufacturers suppliers success zero-emission economy , comes healthy fiscal price tag $ 11.1 billion 2034-35 .detail refundable investment tax credit clean hydrogen . level support vary 15 40 percent eligible costs , highest levels support going projects produce cleanest hydrogen . 15 percent tax credit extended equipment needed convert hydrogen ammonia , order transport hydrogen . projected fiscal cost considerable $ 17.8 billion 2034-35 .canada growth fund managed public sector pension investment board , separate pension assets , enhanced mandate given canada infrastructure bank ( cib ) invest least $ 20 billion support major clean electricity clean growth infrastructure projects . de facto , cib given mandate federal green bank .consultations planned development “ carbon contracts difference ” , uses contract federal government individual affected firms guarantee fixed carbon price defined period therefore making carbon pricing carbon credits predictable .tax credits offered clean fuels covered ira , biofuels .additional subsidies provided personal commercial electric vehicles , home building retrofits , clear signal carbon pricing used nudge consumer business behaviour .overall , climate industrial policy package budget 2023 selective expensive . canada matched ira ’ overall coverage . initiatives selective , concentrating providing fiscal support investment many types clean electricity , hydrogen , clean-tech manufacturing . focus reflects priority setting budget . specific fiscal incentive investment clean fuels clean tech , may suggest government waiting see pressure investors additional clean investment tax credits . budget also increase subsidies green vehicles , relying carbon pricing provide nudge .budget essentially doubles federal support green finance . cib chosen prime instrument additional support , rather increasing commitments canada growth fund . unlike prior advice , federal commitment expand use green procurement , purchases direct air capture , meaning measures addressing hard-to-reduce federal emissions military activity .package expensive , total announced tax credits $ 80 billion , although amount comparable relative terms private sector estimates us ira costs . overall , ottawa made big bet zero-emission electricity hydrogen energy sources future , clean technology manufacturing . areas , canada able maintain perhaps even strengthen competitive position .faced competitive threat sweeping us climate industrial policy , canadian federal government response unavoidable . various budget initiatives focused “ clean ” investment finance help canada compete activities within north america , steadily shifting locus canadian energy economic growth toward zero emissions activities . providing refundable tax credits clean investment comes high fiscal cost , could upside potential – also economic cost acting level playing field vis-à-vis us , potentially resulting lost investment , production , jobs export opportunities .still early days climate-related industrial policy . anticipated policy implemented us , eu , china elsewhere reduce emissions set course toward net zero . could also policy pull backs deviations . canadian climate fiscal policy therefore need take fully account competitive threat posed ongoing policy developments us elsewhere , seeking canada ’ initiatives green supply-chain products treated equivalent various policies adopted important trading partners . delivering coherent , integrated climate economic development policy reasonable cost canadians require vigilance constant adaptation international domestic forces

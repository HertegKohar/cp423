charles deland - nuclear blueprint albertafans canadian nuclear energy much root days . two recent ontario announcements , one small modular reactors one new large-scale project , indicate meaningful commitment nuclear energy meet rising demand . along hydro , nuclear power emits virtually zero greenhouse-gas emissions , foundational meet federal emissions targets .albertans chance learn ontario ’ ambition – recent mandate letter premier danielle smith , presents well-timed opportunity even .among things , asks co-ordinate “ provinces federal government explore promote small micro modular reactor technologies pave way use oilsands operations petrochemical production ” work “ minister environment protected areas , develop implement regulatory framework small modular reactor technology use alberta . ”ontarians enjoyed stable electricity traditional large-scale nuclear fleet decades – one still produces 60 per cent power . recognizing forecasts growing demand , ontario government announced last month bruce power would start work determine feasibility 4,800 megawatts new nuclear generation current lake huron site .addition , province said working ontario power generation ( opg ) start planning licensing total four small modular reactors ( smrs ) , total 1,200 mw output , darlington nuclear site .projects face lengthy permitting processes , all-too-certain cost-control challenges many years produce power , plans encouraging sign . underlined recent c.d . howe institute study john richards christopher mabry , nuclear stable source reasonably priced emission-free electricity .alberta gain ontario ’ commitment . alberta ’ wind- solar-powered electricity generation investments continue rise rapidly – good thing , notwithstanding last week ’ moratorium announcement – province lacks much emissions-free power available demand . emissions produced generating unit alberta ’ electricity dropped 44 per cent 2005 2021 ( mostly moving natural gas coal ) , electricity sector still emits provincial counterparts .alberta ’ oilsands producers also burn lot natural gas make steam ( power ) extract oil . pathways alliance , oilsands producer coalition , identified exploring alternative power sources , smrs , key means reducing emissions . recent & p global report indicates smrs help oil gas sector reach ottawa ’ 2030 target reducing emissions 42 percent 2019 levels 2040 ( admittedly later government would like , still better economy-damaging production cuts ) .alberta needs get ready .nuclear technology guaranteed solution ( smrs built canada ) , alberta make serious commitment absorb knowledge ontario , federal regulators technical experts across country . province establish regulatory framework quickly possible , learning ontario ’ wins losses , since necessary foundation investment . course , also tailored fit alberta ’ competitive electricity generation market .nuclear critics right point projects often arrive behind schedule budget . consumers businesses stuck consequences avoidable failures . , governments alberta ’ , may therefore encouraged opg says refurbishment four darlington reactors track 2026 – budget .alberta ’ economic heft , energy-regulation experience technically skilled workers could bring mutually beneficial support provincial counterparts conversations federal counterparts . would build coordinated efforts saskatchewan , new brunswick , ontario alberta develop strategic plan deployment small modular reactors 2022 , outlines work done technological readiness , economics , waste management , indigenous public engagement . also identifies policy regulatory framework clarity needed step alberta .concentrated alberta effort help advance aligned interests saskatchewan – major uranium producer . may even help provinces alberta closely follow saskatchewan ’ commitment explore development deployment four smrs , learn saskpower ’ design selection search site . alberta chooses , province could also work achieve shared objectives , including nuclear federal green bond framework , conspicuously excludes .building nuclear alberta neither foregone conclusion easy . time bigger step . working provincial federal partners , alberta establish nuclear regulatory framework quickly possible .charles deland calgary-based associate director , research c.d . howe institute .

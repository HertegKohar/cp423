new muon g-2 result improves measurement factor 2fermi national accelerator laboratory ( aka . fermilab ) , international team scientists conducting sensitive tests standard model particle physics . experiment , known muon g-2 , measures anomalous magnetic dipole moment muons , fundamental particle negatively charged ( like electrons ) 200 times massive . recent breakthrough , scientists fermilab made world ’ precise measurement muon ’ anomalous magnetic moment , improving precision previous measurements factor 2 .results announced thursday , august 10th , described scientific paper submitted muon g-2 collaboration publication . explained , new result based data obtained first three years experiment , recorded anomalous magnetic moment ( g ) precision 0.20 ppm . new value bolsters results first year experiment , announced april 2021 , resolves discrepancy theory experimental results first noticed 20 years ago .break , physicists use standard model explain universe behaves fundamental level ( quantum realm ) . according model , matter composed elementary particles fall two categories : fermions bosons . whereas bosons fall two subsets , gauge ( force carriers ) scalar bosons , fermions broken quarks leptons , divided three “ generations. ” muons fall second generation leptons , called “ neutrinos , reside electron tau neutrinos .diagram showing elementary particles make matter . credit : cernlike electrons , muons tiny electric charge ( ? 1 e ) half-spin ( precession ) occurs presence magnetic field . speed precession depends strength orientation magnetic field , known magnetic moment ( g ) , theory predicts equal 2. muons also interact subatomic particles blink existence surrounding “ quantum foam , ” changes interact magnetic field . standard model accounts known particle interactions predicts quantum foam changes g .however , physicists interested finding possible interactions involving particles yet discovered . purpose muon g-2 collaboration , comprises 181 scientists 40 post-doctoral students 33 institutions seven countries . experiment began 1959 cern ran 1984. followed brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) conducting experiments 1997 2001 , offered first hints behavior muons disagreed standard model .2017 2022 , fermilab conducted next phase experiments , officially wrapped july 9th , 2023 , six years data collection . measurements , collaboration relied superconducting magnetic storage ring originally built bnl transferred 2013. next four years , collaboration upgraded instruments adopted improved techniques simulations sake reducing uncertainty g-2 factor four ( compared bnl result ) .researchers spent six years repeatedly sending beam muons 15.24-meter ( 50-foot ) storage ring , circulated close speed light . first year operation , fermilab experiment collected data prior muon g-factor experiments combined , analyzing motion 8 billion muons . based first three years data , muon g-2 experiment ’ results strongly agreed value found bnl research team . per fermilab ’ announcement , new value announced muon g-2 collaboration :“ addition precise measurement date , results reinforce previous results diverge standard model . brendan casey , senior scientist fermilab worked muon g-2 experiment since 2008 , explained significance research official fermilab press release . “ ’ really probing new territory , ” said . “ ’ determining muon magnetic moment better precision ever seen . improved lot things first year taking data second third yet . constantly making experiment better . ”measurement , collaboration achieved goal decreasing systematic uncertainties caused experimental imperfections . total systematic uncertainty also surpassed design goal first three years , thanks sheer volume data gathered . “ measurement incredible experimental achievement , ” said peter winter , muon g-2 collaboration ’ co-spokesperson . “ getting systematic uncertainty level big deal something ’ expect achieve soon . ”collaboration team spend next years analyzing last three years experiment ’ data , hope complete 2025. six years data incorporated analysis , team make precise measurement muon magnetic moment ever . meantime , scientists new improved measurement help guide future experiments probe beyond standard model . said fermilab scientist chris polly , co-spokesperson current experiment , lead graduate student brookhaven experiment :“ 20 years passed since brookhaven experiment ended , gratifying finally resolving mystery . far analyzed less 6 % data experiment eventually collect . although first results telling us intriguing difference standard model , learn much next couple years . ”

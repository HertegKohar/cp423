weird dark spot neptune may bright spot buddy2018 , dark spot appeared neptune ’ atmosphere , giving astronomers terrific opportunity finally figure sorts shadowy apparitions .voyager 2 encountered neptune 1989 , saw blue ice giant ’ northern hemisphere adorned huge , dark anticyclonic vortex thousands miles diameter . , blemish went away .years since voyager 2 fly-by , hubble space telescope observed similar dark spots come go neptune ’ hemispheres . first glance , blobs appear similar jupiter ’ famous great red spot ( grs ) , grs steadily swirling least 350 years found high jupiter ’ atmosphere . contrast , neptune ’ dark spots seem last years reside deeper ice giant ’ atmosphere .hubble observed another dark spot neptune 2018 , team astronomers , led patrick irwin university oxford , sprang action .related : neptune 's clouds vanished , sun may blame ( video )neptune ’ dark spots never observed ground-based telescope , european southern observatory ’ large telescope ( vlt ) chile muse ( multi unit spectroscopic explorer ) instrument , irwin ’ team able detect dark spot spectroscopically measure 3d , revealing going entity different atmospheric depths ., discovered possible answers dark spot ’ mysterious origin . published paper findings thursday ( aug. 24 ) journal nature astronomy .`` since first discovery dark spot , ’ always wondered short-lived elusive dark features , '' irwin said statement .different wavelengths light able probe different depths neptune ’ atmosphere , dictated things like atmospheric composition composition reflects light .using muse , irwin ’ team created three-dimensional reflection spectrum , showed planet 's atmosphere varying depths reflects sunlight . dark spot , designated nds-2018 , appeared fall within region atmosphere ’ reflect much light . observations , made 2019 , thus rule possibility dark spot simply clearing neptune ’ clouds providing view darker layers situated .instead , team reasoned , something atmosphere 's aerosol haze must making spot dark . muse ’ observations showed dark spot likely lies depth pressure 5 bar , pressure layer hydrogen sulfide able condense ice crystals .irwin ’ team identified two explanations case .since hydrogen sulfide light-sensitive gas , one possibility dark spot caused upwelling center vortex bringing hydrogen sulfide deeper inside planet . hydrogen sulfide reaches altitude react solar ultraviolet light , reaction perhaps causes atmosphere darken . possibility hydrogen sulfide condensed around darker particles , local heating caused anticyclonic conditions causes hydrogen sulfide sublimate , revealing darker particles beneath .vlt ’ observations also offered additional surprise : small bright spot , designated dbs-2019 , south-west edge dark spot .`` process [ observing dark spot ] discovered rare , deep , bright cloud type never identified , even space , '' michael wong , planetary scientist university california , berkeley , member irwin ’ team , said statement .bright spots one kind another seen regularly , even earth , atmosphere neptune . voyager 2 , instance , discovered bright clouds methane nicknamed `` scooters '' moved around planet quickly . however , dbs-2019 seems much lower depth scooters , sharing altitude dark spot . may actually bright spot result convection edge dark spot ’ vortex , perhaps pumping brighter material murky , frozen depths .alas , observations dark bright spots fleeting ; disappeared 2022 .currently , neptune ’ atmosphere appears spotless , cloud coverage vanished . disappearance clouds may related sun ’ solar cycle activity drop photoionizing ultraviolet light solar minimum 2019. process may role play formation neptune ’ clouds ; take away clouds begin disappear . hypothesis correct , expect see active neptunian atmosphere solar maximum 2024-2025 .astronomers must wait new dark spot arise continue studies earth , least space mission sets sail follow voyager 2 ’ footsteps visit last planet solar system .paper research published aug. 24 journal nature astronomy .get space.com newslettercontact news offers future brandsreceive email us behalf trusted partners sponsorsby submitting information agree terms & conditions privacy policy aged 16 .keith cooper freelance science journalist editor united kingdom , degree physics astrophysics university manchester .

moon 's southern ice relatively youngaround moon ’ southern polar region lies south pole-aitken basin , single-largest impact basin lunar surface . within basin , numerous permanently shadowed regions ( psrs ) thought trapped water ice time . deposits crucial future missions like artemis program lead creation permanent infrastructure . water ice supply crews steady source water drinking irrigation means chemically producing oxygen gas rocket fuel .scientists , psrs believed emerged moon began migrating away earth roughly 2.5 billion years ago . time , regions acted “ cold sinks ” trapped water ice existed lunar surface time . however , according recent study led planetary science institute ( psi ) , moon ’ permanently shadowed areas arose less 2.2 billion years ago trapped ice even recently . findings could significantly impact future crewed missions indicate water ice found lunar craters could recent origin .image showing distribution surface ice moon ’ south pole ( left ) north pole ( right ) , detected nasa ’ moon mineralogy mapper instrument . credits : nasamoon began steadily migrating away earth , felt tidal forces caused earth ’ sun ’ gravitational pull . decades , scientists known moon experienced major spin axis reorientation point , led formation psrs around lunar south pole . recently , insufficient data determine precisely reorientation occurred . year ago , french research team developed coherent history evolution earth-moon distance . schorghofer explained psi press release :“ heard result , immediately realized profound implications search water ice moon . dropped everything began work specifics , help co-author raluca rufu . calculated lunar spin axis orientation extent psrs based recent advances time evolution earth-moon distance . able quantify young lunar psrs really . average age psrs 1.8 billion years , . ancient reservoirs water ice moon . ”clear , moon long history hosting water ice surface . water distributed comets meteors roughly 4.1 3.8 billion years late heavy bombardment resulted volcanic outgassing . however , processes started dying permanently shaded areas started appearing 3.4 billion years ago . means water delivered impactors outgassed interior could trapped polar regions . short , water ice observe today must recent .“ findings change prediction would expect find water ice moon , dramatically changes estimates much water ice moon . ancient water ice reservoirs longer expected , ” schorghofer concluded .artist impression lcross approaching moon . credit : nasaconsistent nasa ’ lunar crater observation sensing satellite ( lcross ) observed 2009 investigating hydrogen signatures previously observed around polar regions . lcross deployed impactor cabeus crater , detected water debris kicked . since psr within cabeus crater less 1 billion years old , water , carbon dioxide , volatiles must collected recently . rather encouraging since young psrs could accumulate lots ice relatively quickly , meaning older ones even .findings might also help address mystery mercury considerably ice polar regions moon . previous data indicated psrs mercury much older may capturing water far earlier .

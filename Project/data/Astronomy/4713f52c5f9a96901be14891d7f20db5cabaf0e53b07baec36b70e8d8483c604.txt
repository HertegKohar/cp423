hubble sees mysterious flash galaxiesnight sky may appear tranquil ( incredibly beautiful ) , cosmos filled constant stellar explosions collisions . among rarest transient events known luminous fast blue optical ( lfbots ) , shine intensely bright blue light fade days . transient events detectable telescopes continually monitor sky . using venerable hubble space telescope , international team astronomers recently observed lfbot far two galaxies , last place expected see one .first lfbot observed 2018 ( at2018cow ) asteroid terrestrial-impact last alert system ( atlas ) . event , nicknamed “ cow , ” 10–100 times brighter normal supernova took place galaxy roughly 200 million light-years ( 60 million parsecs ) away . since , astronomers detected lfbots rate one year , handful known , little known . several theories possible causes exist , hubble ’ recent discovery made phenomenon even mysterious .initial detection , latest lfbot ( at2023fhn , aka . “ finch ” ) observed multiple telescopes various wavelengths – x-rays radio waves . zwicky transient facility , extremely wide-angle ground-based camera scans entire northern sky every two days , first alert astronomers event april 10th , 2023. spotted , researchers activated pre-planned program observations , causing gemini observatory , nasa ’ chandra x-ray observatory , nsf ’ large array ( vla ) train instruments finch .gemini south telescope chile obtained spectroscopic measurements , revealed finch temperature 19,980 °c ( 36,000 °f ) . also helped determine distance earth , allowing astronomers calculate luminosity . combined chandra ’ x-ray data radio data vla telescopes , findings confirmed explosion characteristics lfbot . shined intensely blue light evolved rapidly , reaching peak brightness fading matter days ( whereas supernovae take weeks months dim ) .unlike lfbots , hubble found finch located 50,000 light-years nearby spiral galaxy 15,000 light-years smaller galaxy . raises serious questions driving massive explosions . popular theory rare extremely powerful type core-collapse supernovae , occur massive stars reach end main sequence explode brilliantly . however , stars short-lived stellar standards , lasting 10-20 million years one hundred million years ( depending overall mass ) .therefore , massive progenitor stars ’ enough time travel far birthplace ( stellar clusters inside galaxies ) reaching end lifespans . whereas previous lfbots found spiral arms galaxies ( star birth ongoing ) , finch outlier . said chrimes recent nasa press release :“ hubble observations really crucial thing . made us realize unusual compared ones like , without hubble data would known . learn lfbots , surprise us . ’ shown lfbots occur long way center nearest galaxy , location finch expect kind supernova . ”artist ’ impression shows two tiny dense neutron stars point merge explode kilonova . credit : university warwick/mark garlickexplain findings , chrimes colleagues considering possibility result collision two neutron stars ejected host galaxy spiraling toward billions years . produce kilonovae , powerful explosions 1,000 times powerful standard nova also well-known source gravitational waves ( gws ) . another theory lfbots caused collisions neutron stars , one magnetar ( highly-magnetized neutron star ) .would greatly amplify power explosion point would exceed supernova factor 100. another possibility lfbots result stars torn apart intermediate-mass black hole ( 100 1,000 solar masses ) . intermediate-mass black holes likely found globular star clusters . coming years , nasa ’ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) could used see finch exploded outer halo one two neighboring galaxies .point , astronomers agree several lfbots must discovered population properly characterized . challenging since transients happen anywhere , time , fleeting astronomical terms ( hence name ) . much like gamma-ray bursts ( grbs ) fast radio bursts ( frbs ) , way detect wide-field surveys constantly monitor large areas sky . detected , space-based ground-based observatories conduct follow-up observations learn properties .assisted greatly vera c. rubin observatory completed 2024 , one many next-generation all-sky survey telescopes observing cosmos shortly . among objectives study “ objects change position brightness time ” – aka transient objects .

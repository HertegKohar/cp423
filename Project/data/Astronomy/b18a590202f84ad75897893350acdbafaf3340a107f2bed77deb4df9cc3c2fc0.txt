improved radioisotope thermoelectric generator could dramatically reduce weight interplanetary missionsradioisotope thermoelectric generators ( rtgs ) power plants interplanetary spacecraft . least going 50 years . significant drawbacks , primary one ’ heavy . even modern-day rtg designs run hundreds kilograms , making useful large-scale missions like perseverance prohibitively large small-scale mission wants get outer planets . solar sails ’ much better , combined solar sail battery system , like one juno , coming twice weight similarly powered rtg . solve problem , group engineers aerospace corporation us department energy ’ oak ridge national lab came way take underlying idea rtg shrink dramatically point could potentially used much smaller missions .concept , known atomic planar power lightweight exploration ( apple ) project , focuses three main goals , according final report released authors :generate powerstore powerprovide heat spacecraft componentsfirst goal self-explanatory – ’ goal previous rtgs , matter . second goal deals another weakness rtgs – start peak power get weaker . rtg system must designed operational lifetime mission mind . mission planned last five years , power output rtg must decay past point still provide power system time frame .apple uniquely solves problem providing energy generation storage one package either radiate heat away direct necessary components . ’ pretty standard practice many industries , design apple makes truly unique .designed tile outputs stores specific amount power . tile either single sided , coat outside spacecraft waste heat generated radiated away , dual-sided , whole assembly isolated strut spacecraft powering , like solar sail .’ impressive tiles strung together – need higher power output ? simply select number tiles right application , assured amount power battery support receive designing spacecraft .long series design decisions considered niac project , results detailed final report back nasa . one primary consideration type isotope use . authors settled plutonium-238 , commonly considered component nuclear bombs . however , context showed reasonable mix heat generation requiring much radiation shielding .fraser discusses options power deep space .radiation shielding another major consideration , tied place batteries tiles material composition . dr. joseph nemanick co-authors ran numerous radiation simulations try answer questions . configured tile largest radiation source affecting battery materials standard project lifetime ( 15-50 years consideration ) would cosmic rays rather highly fissile material contained tile .positioning considerations , place “ hot shoe ” “ cold shoe ” thermoelectric system , also mattered . luckily , models systems improved exponentially past decades , engineers idea best configuration even making parts .apple team make parts , including battery components radiation test setup . however , ’ unclear publicly available data whether project received funding technical development status . apple undeniably solving problem ingeniously – remains seen whether technology adopted myriad small interplanetary missions planned big space agencies .

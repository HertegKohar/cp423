new machine-learning model could help scientists hone best potential life-hosting environments mars — photographed nasa 's perseverance rover —and alien worlds . ( image credit : nasa/jpl-caltech/asu/msss )newly developed machine-learning tool could help scientists search signs life mars alien worlds .ability collect samples planets severely limited , scientists currently rely remote sensing methods hunt signs alien life . means method could help direct refine search would incredibly useful .mind , multidisciplinary team scientists led kim warren-rhodes seti ( search extraterrestrial intelligence ) institute california mapped sparse lifeforms dwell salt domes , rocks crystals salar de pajonales , salt flat boundary chilean atacama desert altiplano , high plateau .warren-rhodes teamed michael phillips johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory university oxford researcher freddie kalaitzis train machine learning model recognize patterns rules associated distribution life across harsh region . training taught model spot patterns rules wide range landscapes — including may lie planets .team discovered system could , combining statistical ecology ai , locate detect biosignatures 87.5 % time . comparison 10 % success rate achieved random searches . additionally , program could decrease area needed search much 97 % , thus helping scientists significantly hone hunt potential chemical traces life , biosignatures .`` framework allows us combine power statistical ecology machine learning discover predict patterns rules nature survives distributes harshest landscapes earth , '' warren-rhodes said statement ( opens new tab ) . `` hope astrobiology teams adapt approach mapping habitable environments biosignatures . ''machine learning tools , researchers say , could applied robotic planetary missions like nasa 's perseverance rover , currently hunting traces life floor mars ' jezero crater .`` models , design tailor-made roadmaps algorithms guide rovers places highest probability harboring past present life — matter hidden rare , '' warren-rhodes explained .picking analog mars earthteam chose salar de pajonales testing stage machine learning model suitable analog dry arid landscape modern-day mars . region high-altitude dry salt lakebed blasted high degree ultraviolet radiation . despite considered highly inhospitable life , however , salar de pajonales still harbors living things .team collected almost 8,000 images 1,000 samples salar de pajonales detect photosynthetic microbes living within region 's salt domes , rocks alabaster crystals . pigments microbes secrete represent possible biosignature nasa 's `` ladder life detection , '' ( opens new tab ) designed guide scientists look life beyond earth within practical constraints robotic space missions .team also examined salar de pajonales using drone imagery analogous images martian terrain captured high-resolution imaging experiment ( hirise ) camera aboard nasa 's mars reconnaissance orbiter . data allowed determine microbial life salar de pajonales randomly distributed rather concentrated biological hotspots strongly linked availability water .warren-rhodes ' team trained convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) recognize predict large geologic features salar de pajonales . features , patterned ground polygonal networks , also found mars . cnn also trained spot predict smaller microhabitats likely contain biosignatures .time , researchers continue train ai salar de pajonales , next aiming test cnn 's ability predict location distribution ancient stromatolite fossils salt-tolerant microbiomes . help learn rules uses search could also apply hunt biosignatures similar natural systems ., team aims begin mapping hot springs , frozen permafrost-covered soils rocks dry valleys , hopefully teaching ai hone potential habitats extreme environments earth potentially exploring planets .team 's research published month journal nature astronomy ( opens new tab ) .

bizarre pulsar switches two brightness modes . astronomers finally figured .pulsars lighthouses universe . rotating dead stars shoot twin jets radiation poles , usually predictable rhythm . sometimes pulsars behave strangely , one pulsar particular astronomers scratching heads years . ’ called psr j1023+0038 , decade ago , shut jets began oscillating two brightness levels unpredictable pattern . , scientists think understand : busy eating neighboring star .supergiant star approaches end lifespan , explode collapse back hole enough mass , neutron star . neutron stars remaining , ultra-dense cores old star . often fast-spinning , subset become pulsars . psr j1023+0038 began life way , discovered 2007 , behaved like normal pulsar .2013 , something changed . radio pulses – evidence twin lighthouse beams – shut . sudden explosion energy multiple wavelengths : gamma rays x-rays increased factor five , visible light star brightened 1-2 magnitude . astronomers also discovered seemed formed accretion disk : hot swirling mass material surrounding star .perhaps strangely , star began alternating two intensities x-ray wavelengths : high mode low mode , continued like entire decade since . spends 70 % time high mode , rest low , alternates two every seconds minutes unpredictable schedule .telescopes covered gamut electromagnetic wavelengths , , astronomers able piece together going .’ found . accretion disk made matter pulled pulsar ’ neighboring star . matter , closes pulsar begins accumulate , heated solar wind . matter begins glow x-ray , uv , visible light , hot , glowing material astronomers seeing pulsar ’ ‘ high mode. ’ eventually , however , process matter expelled high energies , leaving perpendicular accretion disc , direction pulsar ’ jets .“ enormous amounts matter , similar cosmic cannonballs , launched space within brief time span tens seconds , ” says maria cristina baglio new york university abu dhabi , italian national institute astrophysics .violent expulsion results pulsar returning ‘ low mode , ’ removed heated material vicinity .cycle repeats .incredible collaborative effort astronomers around world , using best instruments humanity offer , psr j1023+0038 mystery solved .lessons learned weird pulsar taught us physics accretion , knowledge applied study unexplained variable phenomena , including accretion disks black holes .featured image : artist ’ impression shows pulsar psr j1023+0038 stealing gas companion star . interactions solar wind cause pulsar switch two modes brightness every seconds minutes . credit : eso/m . kornmesser .

polar ring galaxies bizarre rare . astronomers found twogalaxies come range shapes , elegant spirals egg-shaped ellipticals . often categorize galaxies shape , traditionally done based could observe visual spectrum . expanded astronomy radio , infrared , ultraviolet , x-ray light , learned often galaxies structures invisible eyes . take , example , odd type galaxy known polar ring galaxies ( prgs ) .polar ring galaxy spiral elliptical galaxy outer ring gas stars tilted roughly perpendicular galactic plane . ring encircles galaxy polar regions , hence name . often ring primarily diffuse hydrogen gas , seen radio wavelengths .polar ring galaxies first discovered 1978 , still ’ understand form . one idea ring by-product galactic collisions . original galaxies collide dramatically different angles , hydrogen could cast polar alignment . reason , polar ring galaxies thought rare . new survey galaxies suggests prgs relatively common .hese two colliding galaxies may eventually become prg . credit : international gemini observatory/noirlab/nsf/auraresults published monthly notices royal astronomical society , presenting initial results wallaby pilot survey . wallaby , widefield askap l-band legacy all-sky blind survey , project create high-resolution map neutral hydrogen southern hemisphere sky . survey detailed enough capture intergalactic gas , also hydrogen surrounding galaxies . initial stage wallaby mapped hydrogen around 600 galaxies found two polar rings .statistically , means 1 % – 3 % galaxies wallaby surveys polar ring galaxies . survey complete , wallaby could discover hundreds galaxies . currently , less dozen srgs confirmed . significant jump data , astronomers better understand strange galaxies form evolve . may even play significant role understanding dark matter interacts galaxies .

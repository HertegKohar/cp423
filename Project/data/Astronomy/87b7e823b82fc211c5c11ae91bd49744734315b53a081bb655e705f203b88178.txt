penn state seti symposium opens commemoration dr. frank drakehumanity alone universe ? anyone ? everybody ? happens make contact ? questions subjects 2023 penn state seti symposium hosted penn state extraterrestrial intelligence center ( pseti ) june 19th-22nd , 2023. event featured prominent speakers various research fields disciplines discussing challenges , history , future seti . great tradition established dr. frank drake , also addressed key issues related search intelligent life might find someday .summit opened series overviews , review past year ( since last summit ) , presentation dr. rebecca charbonneau , science historian jansky fellow national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) . presentation , titled “ frank drake place history , ” provided retrospective life accomplishments famed radio astronomer seti pioneer dr. frank drake ( drake equation named ) , altered character field , history remember .pseti center actively collaborates institutions , including breakthrough listen laboratory berkeley seti research center seti institute mountain view , california . originally inspired nasa technosignature workshop held 2018 ( many members pseti center attended ) , first seti summit occur 2022 due covid pandemic . year marked second annual summit included plenary sessions experts discussed history seti contributors , breakout sessions addressed ethical issues , results latest searches technosignatures , panel discussions , q & sessions .arecibo radio telescope puerto rico infographic arecibo message ( left ) . credit : seth shostak/seti institute/associated presspioneerseptember 2nd , 2022 , r dr. frank donald drake passed away age 92. drake perhaps best known probabilistic argument calculates number extraterrestrial civilizations ( etcs ) humanity could communicate – drake equation . contributions science search extraterrestrial intelligence ( seti ) go far beyond . addition mounting first-ever seti experiment ( project ozma ) , integral important attempt message extraterrestrial intelligence ( meti ) – arecibo message .honor drake , dr. rebecca charbonneau – science historian jansky fellow national radio astronomy observatory – delivered lecture recent penn state seti symposium . lecture , titled “ frank drake place history , ” focused drake ’ life , accomplishments , place history , future generations remember . one thing highlighted , knew personal experience , man ’ kindness . impression deepened upon reviewing nraos archives , provided multiple examples warmth friendly nature . indicated , also revealed drake early champion women science :“ nrao , summer student program . includes things like nsf-funded reu experience , also undergraduate graduate internships . happening since 1960 , ’ probably one oldest astronomy student programs united states . frank first summer student program coordinator nrao 1960 , actually advocated women allowed participate first ever class summer students . highly strongly discouraged [ nrao ] deputy director time . told ‘ waste funds summer students program women , ’ would get pregnant go field anything . frank pushed back . ”, dr. charbonneau said , two first students – elen gunderson margaret hurley – assisted dr. drake organizing project ozma , demonstrating valuable contributions women science . another major issue dr. charbonneau addressed title often attributed drake – “ father seti ” – even though first scientist search evidence intelligent life cosmos .frank drake green bank telescope . credit : nrao/nsf/aui“ father seti ”whereas project ozma often credited first seti project ( drake first seti scientist ) , historical antecedents experiment often overlooked . heart , said charbonneau , lies problem definitions qualifiers , clarify issue one bit :“ people thinking extraterrestrial inelligence millennia , early greek atomists wodnering ‘ plurality worlds. ’ , one might tempted say ‘ okay , well seti first started actually looking . project ozma first seti project. ’ ’ quite right either , go historical record , number cases find people made ( * call ) ‘ search attempts ’ – , least , search proposals . ”examples charbonneau cited included 19th-century mathematician karl gauss ’ , proposed creating giant petroglyph pythagorean theorem believed would visible intelligent beings living moon . also experiments early radio pioneers like guglielmo marconi , thomas edison , nikolai tesla , reported detecting signals wireless telegraphy equipment – believed mars outer space – recommended using emerging radio technology interplanetary communication .percival lowell ’ telescopic observations mars late-19th early-20th centuries search “ canals ” indications advanced civilization . “ national radio silence day ” campaign led american astronomer david peck todd u.s. naval observatory august 1924. coinciding mars opposition brought two planets closest ’ century , people encouraged turn radios five minutes hour , every hour , three days ( august 21st 23rd ) todd colleagues could “ listen ” signals mars dirigible-mounted radio receiver .end , said charbonneau , project ozma still “ feels ” like first seti experiment shifted character science . argued comes change ideas tools timing , happened cold war early days space race . “ moment time great public consciousness space , first moment space first artificial signals space , ” said .events period – first satellites space , development intercontinental ballistic missiles , efforts send first humans orbit – fundamentally altered nature scientific community general public interested . hopes achieving greatest dreams humanity ( setting foot another celestial body ) intermingled fears nuclear annihilation .drake equation , mathematical formula probability finding life advanced civilizations universe . credit : university rochesterlongevity civilizationfurthermore , charbonneau posited frank ’ greatest contribution project ozma drake equation . recap , equation states number civilizations milky way humanity communicate ( n ) comes rate star formation galaxy ( r * ) , fraction stars planetary systems ( fp ) , fraction planets habitable ( ne ) , fraction planets life emerge ( fe ) , fraction planets develop intelligent life ( fi ) , fraction civilizations develop transmission technology ( fc ) , length time civilizations transmit signals space ( l ) . mathematically , equation expressed follows :n = r * x fp x ne x fe x fi x fc x lparticularly special drake equation , said charbonneau , changed character think extraterrestrial life existence species planet . , resulted living age nuclear annihilation considered possibility constant threat . respect , claims significant part drake equation variable expresses longevity civilizations ( l ) measure detectability :“ suddenly , development atom bomb cold war , first time capable destroying civilization . fall rome , end entire species , indeed , perhaps enire planet . , l really changed character think seti . think frank agreed . ”certainly case made . explored previous article , suggested humanity heard extraterrestrial civilizations ( fermi paradox ) dead . slight variation theory brief window hypothesis , asserts communicating etc matter timing , ’ right window , miss transmissions . ’ also great filter hypothesis , contends something cosmos could prevent life reaching advanced stage development ( point presence activities would noticed ) .“ filter ” could anything natural causes ( flare activity , gamma-ray bursts , etc . ) intelligent life prone self-destruction ( nuclear war , ecological damage , etc. ) . examined lens history , becomes apparent seti much influenced time period takes place . conducting pioneering work early 1960s adopting approach appreciated complexity searching evidence intelligent life , drake helped establish frameworks practices still use day .seti institute hosting series workshops part sign space

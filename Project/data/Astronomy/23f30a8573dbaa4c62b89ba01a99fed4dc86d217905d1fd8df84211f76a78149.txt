rare iron meteorite could help reveal secrets early solar systemrare iron meteorite fell earth fireball blazed sweden 2020 . ( image credit : andreas forsberg anders zetterqvist . )scientists studied rare iron meteorite detail , discovering orbit parent body occupied crashing earth . first iron meteorite orbit calculated .12-inch-long ( 30 centimeters ) , 30-pound ( 14 kilograms ) chunk space rock fell earth fireball erupted sweden 2020. iron meteorites constitute around 2 % space rocks make earth 's surface , object became rare valuable sample researchers .iron meteorites believed fragments molten metallic cores heart planetesimals , small bodies existed around 4.5 billion years ago . many bodies eventually came together back form solar system 's planets , including earth ., studies meteorites like reveal valuable information state solar system infancy sorts elements ended becoming incorporated planets , study team members said .“ excellent opportunity research occurred bright fireball , mainly observed finnish fireball network , november 7 , 2020 , sweden , produced first iron meteorite possibility derive pre-atmospheric trajectory , '' jaakko visuri , analyst finnish fireball network ursa astronomical association , said statement . `` provided us unique chance study delivery mechanism iron meteorites look iron-rich reservoirs solar system . ''seizing opportunity team astronomers ukraine , led irina belskaya , head department physics asteroids comets kharkiv national university 's institute astronomy . research conducted part project started 2020 dedicated studying metal-rich asteroids , parent bodies iron meteorites .`` first time , discovery presents documented trajectory iron meteoroid , showcasing record-breaking fireball descent mere 7 miles ( 11.4 kilometers ) earth 's surface also unraveling celestial pathways traversed gracing planet , '' said finnish geospatial research institute researcher maraia gritsevich . ( meteoroids small space rocks ; become meteors hit earth 's atmosphere burn . pieces rocks make earth 's surface called meteorites . )`` achievement provides insights remarkable journey endured also contributes understanding origins dynamics iron-rich space objects , thereby deepening insight broader solar system , '' gritsevich added .among information scientists collected meteorite clues conditions processes led formation . could help determine chemical resources distributed solar system .work could , turn , potentially help prepare future space missions hunt metal-rich asteroids could enticing space-mining targets .calculating orbit meteorite 's parent body helps paint picture celestial mechanics play early solar system , including interactions bodies cosmic backyard gravitational forces play .addition , better predicting path object could help constrain orbits asteroids , implications planetary defense , study team members said . , small iron-rich rock space could become stepping stone wealth future space science .get space.com newslettercontact news offers future brandsreceive email us behalf trusted partners sponsorsby submitting information agree terms & conditions privacy policy aged 16 .robert lea science journalist u.k. whose articles published physics world , new scientist , astronomy magazine , space , newsweek zme science . also writes science communication elsevier european journal physics . rob holds bachelor science degree physics astronomy u.k. ’ open university . follow twitter @ sciencef1rst .would good see meteorite reports , radiometric age ( ) found . show spread ages using different isotopes cre age ( ) ( cosmic ray exposure ages ) . perhaps future , system record ( central repository ) discloses age measurements public .

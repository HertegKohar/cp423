artist 's concept shows voyager 1 spacecraft entering space stars . interstellar space dominated plasma , ionized gas ( illustrated brownish haze ) , thrown giant stars millions years ago.credit : nasa .’ official : voyager 1 interstellar spacecosmically historic announcement , nasa says distant human made object — voyager 1 spacecraft — interstellar space , space stars . actually made transition year ago .“ made ! ” said smiling dr. ed stone , voyager ’ project scientist 40 years , speaking briefing today . “ still enough power send back data new region space. ” bit argument semantics whether voyager 1 still inside outside solar system ( farther oort cloud — take 300 years reach oort cloud spacecraft closer sun star ) plasma environment voyager 1 travels definitely changed comes sun plasma present space stars .stone says evidence clear : voyager 1 made transition .“ conclusion possible space craft ’ plasma wave instrument , ” stone said . “ 36-year old probe sailing uncharted waters new cosmic sea brought us along journey . ”voyager 1 ’ 36-year , 13 billion mile journey began 1977 .scientists thought spacecraft crossed interstellar space , magnetic field direction would change . however , turned ’ happen , scientists determined needed look properties plasma instead .sun ’ heliosphere filled ionized plasma sun . outside bubble , plasma comes explosions stars millions years ago . main tell-tail difference interstellar plasma denser .unfortunately , real instrument designed make measurements plasma quit working 1980 ’ , scientists needed different way measure spacecraft ’ plasma environment make definitive determination location .instead used plasma wave instrument , located 10-meter long antennas voyager 1 unexpected “ gift ” sun , massive coronal mass ejection .antennas radio receivers ends – “ like rabbit ears old television sets , ” said gurnett , led plasma wave science team university iowa . cme erupted sun march 2012 , eventually arrived voyager 1 ’ location 13 months later , april 2013. cme , plasma around spacecraft began vibrate like violin string .pitch oscillations helped scientists determine density plasma . stone said particular oscillations meant spacecraft bathed plasma 40 times denser encountered outer layer heliosphere .“ new , key data , believe mankind ’ historic leap interstellar space , ” said stone , “ voyager team needed time analyze observations make sense . answer question ’ asking — ‘ yet ? ’ yes , . ”artist ’ impression voyager 1 ’ position sky observed long baseline array ( vlba ) february 21 , 2013 , point — according nasa ’ jet propulsion laboratory — voyager already outside solar system . actual image data ( enlarged section ) 0.5 arcseconds across . radio signal shown mere 1 milliarcsecond across . credit : alexandra angelich , nrao/aui/nsf .plasma wave science team reviewed data found earlier , fainter set oscillations october november 2012 cmes . extrapolation measured plasma densities events , team determined voyager 1 first entered interstellar space august 2012 .“ literally jumped seats saw oscillations data — showed us spacecraft entirely new region , comparable expected interstellar space , totally different solar bubble , ” gurnett said . “ clearly passed heliopause , long-hypothesized boundary solar plasma interstellar plasma . ”time , stone said , “ certainly new region edge solar system things changing rapidly . yet able say voyager 1 entered interstellar space , ” adding data changing ways team ’ expect , “ voyager always surprised us new discoveries . ”, review , voyager team generally accepts august 2012 date date interstellar arrival . charged particle plasma changes would expected crossing heliopause . reinforces definitive science results ’ always come fast .“ team ’ hard work build durable spacecraft carefully manage voyager spacecraft ’ limited resources paid another first nasa humanity , ” said suzanne dodd , voyager project manager , based nasa ’ jet propulsion laboratory , pasadena , calif. “ expect fields particles science instruments voyager continue send back data least 2020. ’ wait see voyager instruments show us next deep space . ”today , gurnett revealed timing scientists “ official ” agreement due timing review process scientific papers . “ paper submitted month , got review cycle , ” said . “ basically theory paper . ”voyager 1 twin , voyager 2 , launched 16 days apart 1977. fortuitous planetary alignment happens every 176 years enabled two spacecraft join together reach outer planets 12 year time period . spacecraft flew jupiter saturn . voyager 2 also flew uranus neptune . voyager 2 , launched voyager 1 , longest continuously operated spacecraft . 9.5 billion miles ( 15 billion kilometers ) away sun .voyager mission controllers still talk receive data voyager 1 voyager 2 every day , though emitted signals currently dim , 23 watts — power refrigerator light bulb . time signals get earth , fraction billion-billionth watt . data voyager 1 ’ instruments transmitted earth typically 160 bits per second , captured 34- 70-meter nasa deep space network stations . traveling speed light , signal voyager 1 takes 17 hours travel earth . data transmitted jpl processed science teams , voyager data made publicly available .“ voyager boldly gone probe gone , marking one significant technological achievements annals history science , adding new chapter human scientific dreams endeavors , ” said john grunsfeld , nasa ’ associate administrator science washington . “ perhaps future deep space explorers catch voyager , first interstellar envoy , reflect intrepid spacecraft helped enable journey . ”scientists know voyager 1 reach undisturbed part interstellar space influence sun . also certain voyager 2 expected cross interstellar space , believe far behind .“ sense really beginning . ’ going completely alien environment voyager going discover truly unknown , ” said gary zank , department space sciences university alabama , huntsville , speaking today ’ press conference .voyager 1 keep going , always able communicate , . 2025 instruments turned , science team able operate spacecraft 10 years get engineering data . voyager 1 aiming toward constellation ophiuchus . year 40,272 ad , voyager 1 come within 1.7 light years obscure star constellation ursa minor ( little bear little dipper ) called ac+79 3888. swing around star orbit center milky way , likely millions years .

jwst found carbon europa , boosting moon ’ potential habitabilityplanets moons solar system clearly dead totally unsuitable life . earth exception . worlds intriguing possibilities life .chief among jupiter ’ moon europa , jwst discovered carbon . makes moon subsurface ocean even desirable target search life .life needs chemical diversity , among diversity , carbon necessity . jwst detected abundant carbon dioxide specific location europa ’ surface called tara regio , region full ’ called chaos terrain . location important .finding carbon dioxide europa ’ surface ’ necessarily mean ’ carbon moon ’ subsurface ocean , needs bolster possibility life . surface carbon dioxide could ’ delivered surface external source , maybe meteorites . ’ case , ’ indicate ’ carbon ocean action .chaos terrain disrupted region europa ’ ice shell ridges , cracks , bumps , smooth regions jumbled together chaotically . regions upheaval , material potentially move back forth surface ocean . finding carbon dioxide strong indication carbon came ocean .“ earth , life likes chemical diversity — diversity , better . ’ carbon-based life . understanding chemistry europa ’ ocean help us determine whether ’ hostile life know , whether might good place life , ” said geronimo villanueva nasa ’ goddard space flight center greenbelt , maryland .carbon backbone life readily forms bonds many different types atoms . needs diverse chemicals around form types molecules . diversity means potential chemical world , finding carbon came ocean exciting hint types molecules might form europa ’ ocean .“ think observational evidence carbon see europa ’ surface came ocean . ’ trivial thing . carbon biologically essential element , ” added samantha trumbo cornell university .graphic shows map

time took jwst find carbon dioxide . powerful space telescope needed minutes precious observing time detect carbon . hopefully , ’ indication future observations solar system .“ observations took minutes observatory ’ time , ” said heidi hammel association universities research astronomy . hammel also webb interdisciplinary scientist leading webb ’ cycle 1 guaranteed time observations solar system . cycle 1 gto devotes 400 hours observing time studying solar system , using minutes detect carbon impressive accomplishment . “ even short period time , able really big science . work gives first hint amazing solar system science ’ able webb , ” hammel said .jwst ’ europa observations led two new papers journal science . though authors papers clearly excited findings , also urge caution . “ interpret observations indicating carbon sourced within europa , ” write one . , write “ propose co2 formed internal ocean , although rule formation surface radiolytic conversion ocean-derived organics carbonates . ”plumes water could responsible delivering material europa ’ ocean surface . hubble spotted years ago also watched europa transited across jupiter ’ disk ten times find . hubble

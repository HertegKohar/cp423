first light universe helps build dark matter map1960s , astronomers began noticing pervasive microwave background visible directions . thereafter known cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , existence relic radiation confirmed big bang theory , posits matter condensed onto single point infinite density extreme heat began expanding ca . 13.8 years ago . measuring cmb redshift comparing local distance measurements ( using variable stars supernovae ) , astronomers sought measure rate universe expanding .around time , scientists observed rotational curves galaxies much higher visible mass suggested . meant either einstein ’ theory general relativity wrong universe filled mysterious , invisible mass . new series papers , members atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) collaboration used background light cmb create new map dark matter distribution covers quarter sky extends deep cosmos . map confirms general relativity predictions mass alters curvature spacetime .act international

suzanne staggs , henry dewolf smyth professor physics princeton university director act :“ ’ bit like silhouetting , instead black silhouette , texture lumps dark matter , light streaming fabric

often referred “ cosmic web ” ) , seen clearly image . map also breaks convention measuring distribution matter universe , terms light terms mass .said co-author blake sherwin , 2013 ph.d. alumnus princeton professor cosmology university cambridge ( leads act research group ) :“ mapped invisible dark matter distribution across sky , theories predict . stunning evidence understand story structure universe formed billions years , big bang today . remarkably , 80 % mass universe invisible . mapping dark matter distribution across sky largest distances , act lensing measurements allow us clearly see invisible world . ”“ ’ made new mass map using distortions light left big bang , ” said princeton assistant professor mathew madhavacheril , 2016-2018 princeton postdoc lead author one papers . “ remarkably , provides measurements show ‘ lumpiness ’ universe , rate growing 14 billion years evolution , ’ expect standard model cosmology based einstein ’ theory gravity . ”simple

flower professor astronomy university pennsylvania deputy director act , one handful researchers saw potential experiment back early 2000s . “ proposed experiment 2003 , idea full extent information could extracted telescope , ” said . “ owe cleverness theorists , many people built new instruments make telescope sensitive , new analysis techniques team came . ”results could also provide new insight so-called “ crisis cosmology , ” light measurements using cmb vs. local stars produce different values . also known “ hubble tension , ” disparity suggests dark matter “ lumpy ” enough standard model cosmology ( lcdm ) may incorrect . however , act team ’ latest results precisely assessed size distribution lumps determined perfectly consistent lcdm model . staggs , whose team built detectors gathered data past five years , believes new map could turn “ crisis ” opportunity :“ cmb famous already unparalleled measurements primordial state universe , lensing maps , describing subsequent evolution , almost embarrassment riches . second , primordial map universe . instead ‘ crisis , ’ think extraordinary opportunity use different data sets together . map includes dark matter , going back big bang , maps looking back 9 billion years , giving us layer much closer us . compare two learn growth structures universe . think going turn really interesting . two approaches getting different measurements fascinating . ”act decommissioned september 2022 ( 15 years operation ) , data gathered still inspire new research breakthroughs . papers presenting results final set observations dr6 expected soon , simons observatory conduct future observations sight . done using new telescope scheduled begin operations 2024 capable mapping sky almost ten times fast act . perhaps look forward all-sky surveys map distribution dark matter going back beginning cosmos .

neptune 's cloud cover linked solar cyclewhenever neptune reaches closest point sky earth , portrait taken hubble space telescope ground-based observatories . watching planet 1994 2020 , astronomers made puzzling discovery .clouds neptune ’ atmosphere appear linked solar cycle planet ’ cycle seasons . global cloud cover seems come go cycle apparently syncs sun ’ 11-year cycle , shifts solar maximum solar minimum vice versa . surprising since neptune far sun receives 0.1 % earth ’ sunlight .discovery based three decades neptune observations captured hubble space telescope , keck observatory hawaii , lick observatory california .“ remarkable data give us strongest evidence yet neptune ’ cloud cover correlates sun ’ cycle , ” said imke de pater , emeritus professor astronomy uc berkeley senior author study , nasa press release . “ findings support theory sun ’ uv rays , strong enough , may triggering photochemical reaction produces neptune ’ clouds . ”neptune ’ four seasons last approximately 40 years planet ’ 165-year orbit around sun .currently , cloud coverage neptune extremely low , five years ago abundance clouds . astronomers making observations noted abundance clouds normally seen icy giant ’ mid-latitudes started fade 2019 .“ surprised quickly clouds disappeared neptune , ” de pater said . “ essentially saw cloud activity drop within months . ”“ even , four years later , recent images took past june still show clouds ’ returned former levels , ” said erandi chavez , graduate student center astrophysics | harvard-smithsonian ( cfa ) cambridge , massachusetts , led study undergraduate astronomy student uc berkeley . “ extremely exciting unexpected , especially since neptune ’ previous period low cloud activity nearly dramatic prolonged . ”chavez team analyzed keck observatory images taken 2002 2022 , hubble space telescope archival observations beginning 1994 , data lick observatory california 2018 2019 .nearly-30-year-long set observations shows number clouds grows increasingly following peak solar cycle – sun ’ level activity rhythmically rises falls approximately 11-year period . graph , , shows images hubble space telescope , sun ’ level ultraviolet radiation plotted vertical axis . 11-year cycle plotted along bottom 1994 2022. hubble observations clearly show correlation cloud abundance solar peak activity .periods intense solar activity – includes increasing number sunspots solar flares — intense ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation floods solar system . team found positive correlation number clouds ice giant ’ brightness sunlight reflecting .“ clear positive correlation find cloud activity solar lyman-alpha irradiance lends support theory periodicity neptune ’ cloud activity results photochemical cloud/haze production triggered solar ultraviolet emissions , ” team wrote .appears two-year delay clouds increase photochemistry takes time form clouds .still open questions observations . example , increase uv sunlight could produce clouds haze , could also darken , thereby reducing neptune ’ overall brightness . also storms neptune rising deep atmosphere could affect cloud cover , related photochemically produced clouds . may complicate correlation studies solar cycle .team said continue track neptune ’ cloud activity see long current near-absence clouds last . taken advantage james webb space telescope ’ observations planet , still analyzing jwst data .“ seen clouds recent keck images taken time nasa ’ james webb space telescope observed planet ; clouds particular seen northern latitudes high altitudes , expected observed increase solar uv flux past approximately 2 years , ” said de pater .

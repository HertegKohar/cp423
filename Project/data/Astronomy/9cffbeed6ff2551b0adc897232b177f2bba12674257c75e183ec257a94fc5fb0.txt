eris could slushier pluto2005 , astronomer mike brown colleagues chad trujillo david rabinowitz announced discovery previously unknown planetoid kuiper belt beyond neptune ’ orbit . team named object eris greek personification strife discord , assigned iau year later . along haumea makemake , similarly observed 2004 2005 ( respectively ) , object led “ great planet debate , ” continues day . meanwhile , astronomers continued study trans-neptunian region learn objects .subsequent observations allowed astronomers get better idea eris ’ size mass , many unresolved questions structure “ dwarf planet ” compares pluto . recent study , mike brown university california santa cruz professor francis nimmo presented series models based new mass estimates eris ’ moon dysnomia . according results , eris likely differentiated convecting icy shell rocky core , sets apart pluto ’ conductive shell .paper , “ internal structure eris inferred spin orbit evolution , ” recently appeared journal science advances . research began nimmo visiting professor brown caltech realized previously-unpublished data could help reveal information properties eris . present , know eris size mass pluto highly eccentric orbit around sun , ranging 38.271 au perihelion 97.457 au aphelion . almost twice eccentric pluto ’ orbit roughly 50 % farther sun .comparison eight largest tnos earth ( scale ) . credit : nasa/lexiconseveral months , brown nimmo worked models eris incorporated two key pieces information . first eris ’ known satellite , dysnomia , two bodies always face way toward . “ happens big planet gets spun tides little moon raises , ” said nimmo recent ucsc press release . “ bigger moon , faster planet spins . soon know , actually start real calculations . ”astronomers use spin orbital characteristics planets moons infer certain properties , like internal structures . recently , scientists estimates dysnomia ’ size , mass , density . luckily , brown colleague bryan j. butler – researcher national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) – recently conducted observations dysnomia eris ( orcus satellite vanth ) using atacama large millimeter-submillimeter array ( alma ) . based findings , published planetary science journal , dysnomia diameter 615 km ( 382 mi ) dysnomia eris mass ratio 0.0085 .upper mass limit provided second crucial piece information , concerned eris ’ internal structure . main result brown nimmo ’ model ( expect ) eris surprisingly dissipative , concept thermodynamics system operates equilibrium . , determined eris rocky core surrounded layer ice crust likely convecting . “ rock contains radioactive elements , produce heat , ” nimmo said . “ heat get somehow . heat escapes , drives slow churning ice . ”sets apart pluto , conducting shell , revealed new horizon mission . brown nimmo hope exact measurements dysnomia ’ mass available near future , well additional data shape eris . distance , eris appears single pixel light , dysnomia visible faint speck next ( see ) . therefore , astronomers must monitor eris passes front background stars reconstruct shape . similar transit method astronomers use detect exoplanets constrain sizes .eris ( center ) moon dysnomia ( left center ) , taken hubble space telescope . credit : nasa/esa/mike brownnimmo summarized , measurements help brown refine models created :“ dysnomia smaller , eris even squishy . make point eris pretty smooth ’ surface topography , ice going flow , topography go away . would nice get measurements shape eris ’ irregular , would agree model . ”“ star blinks star comes back , tells wide eris point . whole bunch stars , actually reconstruct shape . ’ hoping people actually , ’ know whether . ”

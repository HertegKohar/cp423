new way measure expansion rate universe : redshift drift1929 edwin hubble published first solid evidence universe expanding . drawing upon data vesto slipher henrietta leavitt , hubble demonstrated correlation galactic distance redshift . distant galaxy , light appeared shifted red end spectrum . know due cosmic expansion . space expanding , makes distant galaxies appear recede away us . rate expansion known hubble parameter , good idea value , still bit tension different results .one difficulties resolving tension thus far measure cosmic expansion appears right . also means ’ determine whether cosmic expansion due general relativity subtle extension einstein ’ model . powerful new telescopes built , might able observe evolution cosmic expansion thanks known redshift drift effect .hubble parameter value 70 km/s per megaparsec . means galaxy 1 megaparsec away ( 3 million light-years ) , galaxy appears moving away us 70 km/s . galaxy 2 megaparsecs away , appear recede 140 km/s . greater galaxy ’ distance , greater apparent speed . since universe still expanding , passing year galaxy bit distant , means redshift become slightly larger . words , cosmic expansion means redshifts galaxies drift red time .drift extremely small . galaxy 12 billion light-years away , apparent speed would 95 % speed light , drift would 15 cm/s year . ’ much small current telescopes observe . extremely large telescope ( elt ) starts gathering data 2027 , able observe drift time . estimates 5 – 10 years precise observations , elt able see redshift drifts order 5 cm/s . become powerful tool understanding universe , take lot data lot time . new paper proposes different method using gravitational lensing .authors call effect redshift difference . rather observing redshift galaxy decades , team proposes looking distant galaxies gravitationally lensed closer galaxy . lots distant galaxies lensed closer galaxy us distant one , lensed galaxies appear single distorted arc side foreground galaxy .sometimes gravitational lensing create multiple images distant galaxy . since image distant galaxy takes slightly different path reach us , distance path also slightly different . instead waiting decades galaxy move farther away us , get snapshots galaxy separated years decades . image would slightly different redshift , comparing could measure redshift drift .still beyond current ability detect . waiting telescopes elt come online , search distant lensed galaxies multiple images . way ability detect redshift drift , ’ wait decades result .

spacex 's next-generation megarocket — largest ever built — launched second-ever test flight today ( nov. 18 ) , highly anticipated jaunt took giant vehicle space first time , n't last long . shortly stage separation , rocket 's massive super heavy booster exploded , starship upper-stage vehicle detonating reaching target altitude spacex called `` rapid unscheduled disassembly . ''`` believe right automated flight termination system second stage appears triggered late burn , headed downrange gulf mexico , '' said john insprucker , spacex 's principal integration engineer , live webcast today .north boca chica , south padre island , spectators gathered hundreds morning watch launch . cheered orange light starship 's 33 first-stage raptor engines blazed plume exhaust huge rocket began climb . standing nearly 400 feet ( 122 meters ) tall , starship largest powerful rocket ever built , seen miles stacked standing starbase launch pad .ca n't see spacex 's starship person , score model . standing 13.77 inches ( 35 cm ) , 1:375 ratio spacex 's starship desktop model . materials alloy steel weighs 225g .second test flight fully integrated starship , consists super heavy first-stage booster starship upper-stage spacecraft . first liftoff , occurred april 20 year , go well one . april 's starship launch ended self-destruct command four minutes flight , turning tumbling rocket smoldering fireball .one reason april 's unscheduled disassembly failure starship 's two stages separate . prevent recurrence problem second flight , spacex decided go new strategy : `` hot staging , '' upper stage 's engines begin firing starship super heavy fully separated . concept n't new ; used vehicles like titan ii nasa 's gemini program 1960s russia 's venerable soyuz rocket , still operation .starship 's stage separation occurred time today , 2 minutes 41 seconds liftoff , appeared go smoothly , super heavy booster exploded shortly afterward .`` 're going take data improve hot staging sequence probably improve hardware next flight , '' spacex quality engineering manager kate tice said live webcast . spacex hoped soft-land super heavy gulf mexico test reentry landing processes .starship upper stage continued flying short time stage separation . spacex hoped establish signal acquisition spacecraft target altitude 150 miles ( 250 kilometers ) . telemetry vehicle lost eight minutes liftoff , near end burn stage separation , spacex mission managers , including ceo founder elon musk , eagerly awaiting updates live webcast .spacecraft never expected reach full orbit around earth , instead flying suborbital trajectory splash pacific ocean coast hawaii . `` 're targeting orbit today ; 're targeting almost orbit , '' said siva bharadvaj , spacex operations engineer , adding goal `` get thrust profile similar would need orbit , also energy level ship would need dissipate reentry . '''s worth nothing starship 's second test mission fly longer higher first test flight april 20 , failed stage separation exploded . spacex still considered second try success . last telemetry signal today 's launch pegged starship 's altitude 148 kilometers , 91 miles , well 62-mile ( 100 km ) boundary space .`` honestly , 's incredibly successful day even though rapid unscheduled disassembly super heavy booster ship , '' tice said . `` 's great . got much data , help us improve next flight .

euclid begins 6-year survey dark universejuly 1 , 2023 , euclid spacecraft launched clear mission : map dark distant universe . achieve goal , next 6 years , euclid make 40,000 observations sky beyond milky way . data astronomers able map positions billions galaxies , allowing astronomers observe effects dark matter .several galactic sky surveys , euclid ’ mission take next level . euclid equipped widefield imaging system . 70-minute exposure dark sky , capture image spectra 50,000 galaxies . complete , euclid survey detailed survey galactic positions distances . mission also make several deep sky observations , focuses distant dim galaxies .euclid ’ field view compared moon . credit : esa/esa/euclid/euclid consortium/nasa , s. brunierone mysteries euclid could answer nature dark energy . standard model cosmology describes dark energy property space time . cosmological constant drives cosmic expansion . theories dark energy argue ’ energy field within space time , cosmic expansion ’ constant . euclid study whether cosmic expansion varies , allowing astronomers constrain rule certain models . mission also look dark matter distorts galaxies , allowing us learn properties dark matter interacts regular matter .euclid mission officially began survey valentine ’ day complete 15 % survey year . initial deep sky data set released spring 2025 , data first year general survey released summer 2026 .one reply “ euclid begins 6-year survey dark universe ”’ big fan big surveys . erosita survey released gamma ray survey . half first years data ( russia sits half ) confirm lcdm flat space best model oppose weak lensing surveys deviates lcdm clumping .also get smallest sum neutrino masses almost rejects inverse ordering masses . new neutrino physics result , supporting leptogenesis cause matter/antimatter symmetry breaking almost settling normal vs inverse ordering question ! soon able put results finished survey .

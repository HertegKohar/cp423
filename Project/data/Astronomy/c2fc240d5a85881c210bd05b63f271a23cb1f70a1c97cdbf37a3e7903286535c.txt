illustration shows jupiter like world orbiting dead whire dwarf star . ( image credit : robert lea ( created canva ) )james webb space telescope ( jwst ) already proven adept peering past imaging objects tremendous distances , new breakthrough may seen powerful instrument act almost like scientific crystal ball , staring far future solar system .jwst performed prognostication made possible rare direct direction two extrasolar planets , `` exoplanets , '' orbiting two different dead stars , `` white dwarfs . ''planets strongly resemble solar system gas giants jupiter saturn , white dwarfs also serve analogs sun 's destiny . sun transforms white dwarf , change likely destroy inner solar system planets — way jupiter .`` planets discovered around white dwarf stars . extraordinary two candidate planets similar planets outer solar system temperature , age , mass orbital separation planets previously found , '' susan mullaly , lead author research , yet peer-reviewed , astronomer space telescope science institute , told space.com . `` offers first chance see planetary system looks like star dies . ''snapshot futureplanet candidates directly observed jwst 's mid-infrared instrument ( miri ) orbit white dwarfs wd 1202-232 wd 2105-82. one exoplanet candidate located distance white dwarf host 's equal 11.5 times distance earth sun . candidate sits dead stellar parent , distance 34.5 times separation planet star .masses planets currently uncertain , mullaly colleagues estimating 1 7 times jupiter , massive planet solar system .sun exhausts fuel supply nuclear fusion processes occuring core around 5 billion years , swell red giant . nuclear fusion , however , continue outer layers . see outer layers star reach far mars , swallowing mercury , venus , earth , possibly , red planet . eventually , outer layers cool , leaving smoldering stellar core , white dwarf , surrounded planetary nebula exhausted stellar matter .exoplanet detections , however , hint could happen planets beyond mars , gas giants jupiter saturn , sun dies .`` sun expected turn white dwarf star 5 billion years , '' mullaly said . `` expect planets drift outward , wider orbits , star dies . , wind back clock candidate planets , would expect orbital separations similar jupiter saturn .`` able confirm planets , provide direct evidence planets like jupiter saturn survive death host star . '', white dwarfs heart discovery polluted elements heavier hydrogen helium , astronomers call `` metals . '' could hint happen bodies asteroid belt mars jupiter sun dies .`` suspect giant planets cause metal pollution driving comets asteroids onto surface stars , '' mullaly explained . `` existence planets strengthens connection metal pollution planets . since 25 % 50 % white dwarfs show kind pollution , means giant planets common around white dwarf stars . '', asteroids survive death sun could find pelted corpse jupiter saturn .dual discovery impressive beyond predicts future planetary system — also simply represents rare scientific achievement .rare direct exoplanet detectionsince discovery first exoplanets mid-1990s , astronomers discovered around 5,000 worlds orbiting stars outside solar system . according planetary society , april 2020 , 50 exoplanets discovered direct imaging .light planet vast distances usually overwhelmed intense light planet 's parent star , making directly spotting exoplanet similar sighting firefly sitting lit lamp lighthouse .result , exoplanets usually seen effect light star , either causing dip light output cross , `` transit , '' star 's face `` wobble '' motion created planet gravitationally tugs star .`` directly imaged two exoplanets , means took picture seeing light produced planet , '' mullaly said . `` exoplanets discovered found using transit method measuring motion star . indirect methods tend favor planets much closer star . direct imaging better finding planets farther away star , wider orbital separations . ''explained , spotting planets directly , jwst opened possibility studying worlds ; scientists start investigating things like composition planets ' atmospheres directly measure masses temperatures .mullaly added everything team discovered exoplanets expected , quirks could change astronomers think exoplanets like general .alternatively , strange features targeted worlds could offer tantalizing hints direction long-sought exomoons .`` planets , surprising red mid-infrared might expect . amount light collected jwst 5 7 microns brighter might expect exoplanet candidates given age bright 15 microns , '' mullaly concluded . `` might challenge understanding physics chemistry exoplanet atmospheres .`` maybe means another source light , like heated moon orbiting planet .

nasa 's new horizons became first spacecraft visit dwarf planet pluto july 2015. far-traveling spacecraft also visited distant kuiper belt object ultima thule ( 2014 mu69 ) – called arrokoth – january 2019. new horizons still exploring solar system april 17 , 2021 , spacecraft reached distance 50 astronomical units ( au ) sun . ( one au average earth-sun distance — 93 million miles , 150 million kilometers . )new horizons first nasa 's new frontiers mission probes , medium-class missions designed explore different destinations solar system . ( selected missions include juno jupiter mission osiris-rex mission return sample asteroid bennu . )new horizons initially selected funding 2001 excluded nasa 2003 budget . funding mission reinstated new horizons listed top priority planetary science decadal survey 2003–2013 , identifies scientific targets future exploration .spacecraft typically set design lifetime , similar warranties electronics cars . time , solar particles , cosmic rays phenomena degrade surface spacecraft mess electronics . makes long missions like new horizons especially challenging , requiring backup systems source power ( nuclear power ) keep spacecraft alive far away sun .new horizons launched jan. 19 , 2006 , atlas v rocket cape canaveral air force station florida . power outage high winds delayed two previous launch attempts , new horizons made safely space third try .new horizons ' first target jupiter , visited february march 2007. spacecraft passed less 1.4 million miles ( 2.4 million kilometers ) solar system 's largest planet , making first spacecraft swing since galileo probe finished mission jupiter 2003 .additionally , spacecraft flew stream charged particles swirling behind jupiter . probe found large bubbles charged particles , plasma , also revealed variations stream particles . time , astronomers said observations could help understanding environment around `` hot jupiter '' planets found stars , planets size jupiter orbit close ( equivalent orbit mercury , even closer ) stars .conserve energy lessen chance anything breaking , controllers kept pluto-traveling spacecraft hibernation , aside periodic wake-ups navigation systems checks . nasa probe emerge hibernation december 2014 , could get ready pluto encounter send data back earth .new horizons busy gathering data july 2015 encounter , planned , spacecraft n't communicate earth closest approach pluto dwarf planet 's largest moon , charon . controllers celebrated new horizons phoned home , knew data way .pluto 's distance , 3 billion miles ( 5 billion km ) earth , presented power challenges new horizons designers since sun 's rays distance weak generate power . also long communications delays staying touch 1,054-lb . ( 478 kilograms ) spacecraft . new horizons reached pluto , took 4.5 hours one-way message get earth .according nasa , took 15 months download entire dataset collected horizons ’ encounter pluto charon . new horizons could transmit 1-2 kilobits data per second 6.25 gigabytes total . undoubtedly worth wait .early pictures new horizons showed surprisingly young surface pluto , mountain range high 11,000 feet ( 3,500 meters ) . believed 100 million years old , range likely points recent geological activity surface , 's unclear caused .`` may cause us rethink powers geological activity many icy worlds , '' said john spencer , new horizons geology , geophysics imaging team deputy leader , statement released shortly encounter .youthful terrain — huge plain bereft craters , north mountainous range — popped pictures sent back mid-july 2015. zone informally named sputnik planitia region intense scrutiny , given geologists still trying figure caused .telescopes found several new moons pluto new horizons ' journey dwarf planet , presenting challenge spacecraft navigators , concerned orbital debris affecting spacecraft ’ trajectory . fortunately , moons found well ahead pluto encounter , new horizons faced obstacles whizzing pluto 's system .new horizons ' scientific discoveries included evidence past subsurface ocean charon strange water-ice hills pluto floating frozen nitrogen . 2018 , one study suggested may asphalt layer pluto , beneath world 's surface . scientists also suggested pluto could ingredients life surface , even great distance sun .high-resolution image new horizons shows “ shoreline ” sputnik planitia pluto . ( image credit : nasa/jhuapl/swri )pluto 's planetary status changenew horizons already space international astronomical union voted change pluto 's status `` dwarf planet '' 2006 , following discovery several similar-size objects kuiper belt .new horizons principal investigator alan stern repeatedly said favor decision , especially flyby revealed pluto complex formation history initially anticipated .2017 , group planetary scientists submitted proposal reclassify pluto planet , making recommendations 48th lunar planetary science conference woodlands , texas . proposal redefined `` planet '' round object never experienced fusion ( unlike star ) ; definition expected encompass dwarf planets , also moons . officially , pluto still considered dwarf planet late 2021 .nasa approval 2016 , new horizons ' mission extended take closer look kuiper belt object dubbed 2014 mu69 , nasa nicknamed ultima thule officially known arrokoth .september 2017 , new horizons concluded planned five-month hibernation period preparation probe 's extended mission . december year , new horizons took several photos kuiper belt objects . notably , new horizons ' 2017 photographs included images objects 2012 hz84 2012 he85 .given new horizons ' great distance earth time ( 3.79 billion miles 6.12 billion km earth ) , spacecraft 's images became farthest photos ever captured spacecraft flying earth . previous record held voyager 1 , took famous `` pale blue dot '' image earth feb. 14 , 1990 , 3.75 billion miles ( 6 billion km ) away .new horizons flew arrokoth jan. 1 , 2019. little world far earth nasa n't know 10 hours later flyby successful . closest approach , new horizons zoomed arrokoth distance 2,000 miles ( 3,540 km ) , 5,800 miles ( 9,300 km ) closer craft flew pluto .first photos arrokoth showed made two lobes , almost spherical . nasa nicknamed largest lobe ultima smallest one thule . lobes appeared red ( likely fading time due radiation ) actually used separate objects , , time , gravitationally attracted one another .new horizons far kuiper belt sending data back earth takes significant time . investigators said take roughly 20 months arrokoth data flow back earth , means new information continued arrive late 2020 .get space.com newslettercontact news offers future brandsreceive email us behalf trusted partners sponsorsby submitting information agree terms & conditions privacy policy aged 16 .elizabeth howell ( she/her ) , ph.d. , staff writer spaceflight channel since 2022 covering diversity , education gaming well . contributing writer space.com 10 years joining full-time . elizabeth 's reporting includes multiple exclusives white house office vice-president united states , exclusive conversation aspiring space tourist ( nsync bassist ) lance bass , speaking several times international space station , witnessing five human spaceflight launches two continents , flying parabolic , working inside spacesuit , participating simulated mars mission . latest book , `` taller ? `` , co-written astronaut dave williams . elizabeth holds ph.d. m.sc . space studies university north dakota , bachelor journalism canada 's carleton university bachelor history canada 's athabasca university . elizabeth also post-secondary instructor communications science several institutions since 2015 ; experience includes developing teaching astronomy course canada 's algonquin college ( indigenous content well ) 1,000 students since 2020. elizabeth first got interested space watching movie apollo 13 1996 , still wants astronaut someday . mastodon : https : //qoto.org/ @ howellspace

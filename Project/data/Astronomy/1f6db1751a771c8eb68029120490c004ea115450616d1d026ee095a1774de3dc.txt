c-core develop new earth observation technology conceptsc-core also awarded two contracts canadian space agency ( csa ) agency ’ earth observation service continuity initiative space technology development program ( stdp ) .first contract , worth $ 238,000 , new satellite instrument better measure sea ice thickness weather predictions climate change monitoring . second contract ( “ intelligent early anomaly detection failure prediction support tools ” ) $ 750,000 meant detect spacecraft anomalies early analyzing satellite telemetry . ( identical contract awarded calian advanced technologies . )told , csa awarded $ 6.8 million ten contract categories develop improvements next generation canadian earth observation ( eo ) satellites . launched currently in-service radarsat constellation mission ( three eo satellites ) retired .‘ ice thickness measurement space ’ contract build previous design developed c-core similar airborne ice thickness measurement capability , said chris fowler , director c-core ’ systems group .“ project evaluate potential technology options , develop modeling simulation tools , define key operating requirements , establish path future technology development , ” told spaceq . “ approach work relies use vhf-band radar . radar pulses emitted satellite impinge ice sheet . radar energy reflected various interfaces within ice sheet air-snow interface , snow-ice interface , ice-water interface . reflections interfaces resolved returned signal determine thickness ice . ”c-core hopes generate benefits csa contract go well beyond project . “ technology reaches full potential , could basis new class payload capable directly measuring ice thickness space , ” fowler said .intelligent early anomaly detection failure prediction support tools contract “ detect , prevent and/or mitigate known new anomalies spacecraft telemetry data better manage lifecycle eo satellites , ” said michael henschel , c-core ’ director geoanalytics , develops next-generation ee technology company . “ result introduction tool based machine learning ( ml ) techniques analyze near-real-time telemetry data satellite sensor health . small changes telemetry , information communicated earth satellite , whether eo data feeds instrument/orbit reporting may provide information state satellite would missed normal operation – without use machine learning techniques study telemetry feed . ”tapping ml detect anomalies ‘ behaviour ’ satellite telemetry logical method achieving early detection , chance ground-based engineers deal issues become serious . time , “ emerging field , ” said henschel . make ml-based method work , “ researchers engineers c-core developing new tools working cutting edge new technology development . project contribute body work developing remote test processes specifically orbital environment . ”

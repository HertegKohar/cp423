look night sky find way north star , looking polaris . brightest star ursa minor constellation ( little dipper ) , position relative north celestial pole ( less 1° away ) makes useful orienteering navigation . since age modern astronomy , scientists understood star binary system consisting f-type yellow supergiant ( polaris aa ) smaller main-sequence yellow dwarf ( polaris b ) . observations revealed polaris aa classic cepheid variable , stellar class pulses regularly .20th century , records indicate pulsation period increasing pulsation amplitude declining . recently , changed pulsation period started getting shorter amplitude velocity variations stopped increasing . according new study guillermo torres , astronomer harvard & smithsonian center astrophysics ( cfa ) , behaviors could attributed long-term changes related binary nature system , two stars get closer , secondary perturbs atmosphere primary .cepheid variables stars pulsate radially , causing vary diameter temperature . pulsations directly related changes brightness , makes useful tool measuring galactic extragalactic distances . variable nature polaris confirmed 1911 danish astronomer ejnar hertzsdaprung , hertzsprung–russell diagram partly named . observations conducted throughout 20th century shown polaris consistent pulse period four days , steadily increasing every year .polaris ( alpha ursae minoris ) seen hubble space telescope . credit : nasa/hstdr. torres explained universe today via email , recently began change , leading many astronomers question driving polaris ’ pulsations . “ 150 years 2010 , period getting longer 4 5 seconds year , ” said . “ modern observations shown trend reversed , pulsation period getting shorter . unexpected change , showing still much understand polaris stars like . ”learn polaris ’ pulsation period , torres consulted radial velocity ( rv ) measurements going back 1888. technique consists measuring spectra distant star looking redshift blueshift , indications star moving back forth ( technique also yields accurate estimates velocity ) . torres ’ sample included 3,600 rv measurements , including nearly 1,200 spectroscopic observations carried lick observatory 60 years .allowed torres trace evolution pulsation properties polaris , showed often pulses occur amplitude well . said torres :“ early 1990 ’ amplitude become small thought pulsations stop . however , polaris decided otherwise , late 1990 ’ amplitude started increase , lasted 2015. recent observations indicate amplitude longer increasing , may begin come . additionally , rvs shown behavior may related fact polaris orbited another star , comes close every 30 years may perturbing cepheid ’ outer layers , pulsations take place . ”artist ’ conception shows polaris close companion , known polaris ab . yet another companion star , polaris b , seen speck background right . credit : stscishort , changes polaris ’ pulsation period may result companion disturbing whenever make closest pass . factored , torres able derive improved spectroscopic orbit binary system , something astronomers trying resolve generations . could also lead accurate estimates dynamical masses stellar companion , also subject uncertainty . torres summarized :“ know polaris behaves irregular unpredictable manner . confirmed presence companion , may shed light behavior pulsating stars similar properties help us understand nature oscillations . therefore important keep eye , may still hold surprises us . ”

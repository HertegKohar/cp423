's whole argument whether callisto even differentiated — know 's made ice rock , theoretically rock settle ice kind stratification know happens worlds . whether happens interior callisto could determine whether ocean might form . callisto ocean , would presumably habitable location , would buried beneath thick ice shell ( much thicker europa 's ) . could life evolve thrive conditions ? maybe ! wo n't rule .callisto located ?callisto distant galilean satellites ( others io , europa , ganymede ) , thus farthest away jupiter . counting , 's ~26 jupiter radii away planet , notable primarily 's much farther away next closest neighbor , ganymede ( ~15 jupiter radii away ) .'s interesting fact callisto ?despite considered `` least interesting '' galilean satellites ( rude ! untrue ! ) callisto coolest impact craters solar system ! callisto 's impact basin valhalla largest multi-ring basin solar system , massive number concentric rings spread center like massive ripple . impact scientist , think valhalla , smaller compatriot asgard , incredibly beautiful addition telling us something interior — large number rings thought arise contrast brittle ice shell surface viscous material beneath .

''unveiling ceremony , nasa deputy administrator pam melroy underscored agency 's long history pioneering groundbreaking aviation developments .`` first nasa stands aeronautics . 're groundbreaking aerospace innovation , '' melroy said . `` x-59 proudly continues legacy , representing forefront technology driving aviation forward . ''nasa 's latest x-plane ( ' x ' `` experimental '' ) culmination decades research involved radically different manufacturing approaches including new augmented reality systems , robotic drilling 3d modeling techniques .`` n't airplane , x-plane , '' melroy added . `` 's manifestation collaborative genius . ''melroy admitted initial doubts revolutionary aircraft . `` test pilot , first time looked design went 'hmm , ' really questions . ''particular , melroy referring fact x-59 forward-facing window , design choice helps reduce sonic boom aircraft produces . instead , features nasa calls external vision system , xvs , consists camera cockpit-mounted screen offers pilots augmented-reality view 's front jet .melroy said system potential revolutionize aircraft design .`` n't felt comfortable putting crewed flight vehicle without first testing . groundbreaking technology really beacon guiding us towards future visibility barriers aircraft design overcome inventive solution . ''nasa leadership used unveiling underscore roles agency southern california area played rich american history pushing aeronautics boundaries . `` journey actually began 1947 era supersonic flight started right california high desert test pilot chuck yeager x-1 , '' said nasa 's associate administrator agency 's aeronautics research mission directorate robert pearce .jim free , nasa 's associate administrator , continued sentiment , noting x-59 merely latest long line nasa x-planes revolutionized aviation throughout agency 's history .`` even among x-planes , x-59 special . every aircraft receives x-plane designation specific purpose test new technologies aerodynamic concepts , '' free said , `` special planes push envelope 's possible flight . prove concepts , often go museums .

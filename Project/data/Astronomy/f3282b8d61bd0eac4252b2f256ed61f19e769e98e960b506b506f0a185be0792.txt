( credit : nasa )mars , researchers used orbital imagery discover similar dune patterns , specifically near martian north pole researchers observed minor amounts dune interactions . due dunes reaching state equilibrium surrounding environment , resulting relative spacing similar characteristics appearance size . however , dunes observed slightly lower latitudes exhibited greater amounts interactions due changing winds local surface frost . dunes migrate closer north pole , patterns settle resulting decreased interactions .“ upper bound time takes given dune adjust changes environmental conditions , time takes dune migrate distance one dune length , ” said marvin . “ use diagnose recent changes environmental conditions planetary bodies ’ information images taken orbit radar example . ”dr. lapôtre noted gaining insights dune patterns mars could help better understand mars ’ recent climate , also assist locating subsurface water ice could excavated future astronauts red planet .stated earlier , planetary bodies besides earth mars possess dunes could used better understand climates worlds , one world saturn ’ largest moon , titan . addition dunes , titan moon possesses thick atmosphere , makes target astrobiology search life beyond earth . large moon extensively investigated nasa ’ cassini throughout 2000s 2010s european space agency ’ huygens probe touching titan ’ surface january 2005. made huygens first spacecraft land planetary body outer solar system first landing moon aside earth ’ moon . huygens transmitted data images back earth approximately 90 minutes , provided scientists first-time , up-close look one intriguing moons solar system .recent study helped scientists lay foundation helping us better understand dune interactions worlds , nasa ’ upcoming dragonfly mission titan hopes confirm findings lands moon ’ surface sometime 2030s . mission , dragonfly become second rotorcraft sent another world—the first nasa ’ ingenuity helicopter mars—and mark first powered flight moon . multi-year science mission , dragonfly perform short flights around titan hopes determining prebiotic chemistry potential extraterrestrial life also provide scientists up-close investigation dunes , thus far observed orbit .new discoveries dune interactions earth worlds scientists make coming years decades ? time tell , science !

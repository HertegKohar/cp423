dart 's goal test ability defend earth threatening rock nudging harm 's way . test brilliant success , also revealed battered asteroid came : dimorphos n't form rather ring material flung larger parent , didymos .understand dimorphos , look didymos , two near-earth asteroids create binary system . didymos larger two , half mile ( 800 meters ) across . dimorphos , 525 feet ( 160 ) wide , orbits didymos almost perfectly circular retrograde orbit ( meaning motion orbit opposite direction didymos ' spin ) 12 hours .didymos spinning rapidly — rapidly , fact , bulged ellipsoidal shape around equator . first clue formation dimorphos , researchers explained paper published january preprint database arxiv .asteroids tend lose angular momentum , meaning get spun , usually stay way . didymos probably began spinning long ago , perhaps soon formed . create kind rapid spin , researchers turned something known yorp effect .yorp stands yarkovsky , o'keefe , radzievskii , paddack , names scientists made major contributions understanding phenomenon . yorp effect based fact asteroids perfectly smooth perfectly shaped ; sorts strange bumps , wiggles protrusions .shapes reflect sunlight different ways . one part asteroid may scatter sunlight back toward sun , another part may bounce light completely different direction . though sunlight n't mass , momentum , 's perfectly capable pushing objects , solar sails recently demonstrated .different interactions sunlight , yorp effect leads overall rotation asteroid . effect incredibly small , asteroids n't big either , course millions years , yorp effect go gentle nudge massive spin .dimorphos formedfact , researchers propose yorp effect strong young didymos triggered avalanches surface , flung away parent asteroid due extreme angular momentum . material gathered ring surrounding didymos . researchers estimate didymos may lost half mass process .material naturally calmed little rained back onto didymos , stayed orbit . , dust ice particles stuck together electrostatic attraction — force keeps rubbed balloon sticking .eventually , ring particles coalesced series minimoons , researchers call `` satellitesimals . '' satellitesimals , bigger meters across , interacted collided one another . sometimes , collisions sent satellitesimals back onto surface didymos , sometimes , collisions sent flying space .eventually , enough satellitesimals congealed together form proper satellite : dimorphos .researchers explored several models formation , going ring fully developed satellite . one possibility took century dimorphos form , would lead slow-spinning , extremely lumpy satellite .formation dimorphos took less year , spinning rapidly oblate shape , like parent . reason every collision one satellitesimal onto ever-growing main body , would add bit angular momentum , causing spin faster faster .even though didymos dimorphos near-earth asteroids , small size relative lack shininess make difficult observe detail . nasa 's dart test , finally able get close-up images dimorphos .images reveal surface boulders loosely held together slim gravity small asteroid . overall , dimorphos looks like top — much fatter middle poles . picture exactly predicted fast-formation timescale asteroid .know dimorphos formed , use information understand formation dynamics asteroids , especially ones n't observed detail . formation histories tell us complicated life stories individual asteroids also history solar system 's formation .paul m. sutter astrophysicist suny stony brook flatiron institute new york city . paul received phd physics university illinois urbana-champaign 2011 , spent three years paris institute astrophysics , followed research fellowship trieste , italy , research focuses many diverse topics , emptiest regions universe earliest moments big bang hunt first stars . `` agent stars , '' paul passionately engaged public science outreach several years . host popular `` ask spaceman !

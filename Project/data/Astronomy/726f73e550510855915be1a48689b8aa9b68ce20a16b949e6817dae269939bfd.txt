pulsars detected background gravitational hum universe . detect single mergers ?current gravitational wave observatories two significant limitations . first observe powerful gravitational bursts mergers black holes neutron stars . second observe mergers wavelengths order hundreds thousands kilometers . means observe stellar mass mergers . course , ’ lot interesting gravitational astronomy going wavelengths noise levels , motivated astronomers get clever . one clever ideas use pulsars telescope .concept known pulsar timing array ( pta ) . pulsars rotating neutron stars strong magnetic field aligned way sweeps burst radio energy toward earth rotation . see regular radio flash . pulsars , known millisecond pulsars , rotate quickly emit hundreds radio pulses second . since rotation neutron star almost regular clockwork , pulsars used kind cosmic timepiece ., pulsar moves way , orbiting star , relative motion pulsar causes pulses shift slightly . measure shifts extreme accuracy . observations precise pulsars used measure orbital decay binary systems indirect evidence gravitational waves long could observe directly .even pulsars ’ part binary system , small gravitational tugs cause shift slightly . gravitational wave passes , pulses shift tiny amount . shifts essentially random fluctuation level pulses , ’ see gravitational wave effect single pulsar . need observations lots pulsars see statistical fluctuations . hence , need array pulsar timings .earlier year astronomers nanograv used array 67 pulsars 15 years data able measure background gravitational rumble universe . likely sources background supermassive binary black holes ( smbhs ) , results ’ entirely conclusive . one problem data team could measure gravitational waves , ’ pinpoint point origin .several ongoing pta projects , meaning soon wealth observational data . new study , team proposes data could used pinpoint sources background gravitational waves . idea focuses making precise distance measurements pulsars array . moment , know distance pulsars accurately , distance many pulsars fuzzy . detailed observations pta pulsars observatories long baseline array could give us precision need . knowing distance timing variation pulsar would give us range source . array pulsars , ranges would overlap triangulate source .paper shows , good level accuracy could obtained pta dozen pulsars . initial study focused 2-dimensional array , 3d array also reasonably accurate . certainly accurate enough prove whether background waves come supermassive binary black holes , something ’ yet fully understand .

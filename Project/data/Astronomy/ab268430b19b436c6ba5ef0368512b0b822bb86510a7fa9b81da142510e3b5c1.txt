giant tidal waves crashing onto surface enormous starbinary star systems often appear variable stars . ’ see individual stars either close together far away , see gradual brightening dimming single point light stars orbit . sometimes stars particularly close pass brighten unusual ways . one example known heartbeat star .called heartbeat stars plot brightness time , pattern , light curve , looks like heartbeat seen electrocardiogram . ’ beeping pattern see movies television show character still alive . heartbeat stars pattern two stars highly eccentric orbits . pass close tidal forces distort stars egg shapes , causing brighten . get short spike brightness like heartbeat . several examples heartbeat stars , recently discovered one unusual even heartbeat star . peak brightness 200 times greater typical heartbeat stars , light curve rather unusual shape .light curve macho 80.7443.1718. credit : macleod & loebknown macho 80.7443.1718 , primary star mass 35 suns , secondary star 16 solar masses . orbit every 33 days , closest approach closer mercury sun . strong tidal forces close approach help explain brighten significantly .odd aspect light curve . rather simple spike brightness , stars dim bit slowly , oscillating decay light curve . explain , team ran computer models stars close approach , simulating tidal forces , also fluid dynamics . found couple interesting things .first nearest part orbit , atmospheric material large star captured smaller one . many close binaries exchange matter , unusual case exchange triggers oscillations primary star . companion swings , waves form surface primary star . waves cascade along surface . primary star rotates axis period four days , see waves pass along star every days . explains wobbling decay light curve .macho 80.7443.1718 great example complex binary star interactions . heartbeat binary system affect brightness , stirs pot bit , could change way stars evolve time .

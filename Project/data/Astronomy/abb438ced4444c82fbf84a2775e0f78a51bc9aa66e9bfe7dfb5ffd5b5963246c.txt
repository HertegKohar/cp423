enhanced greenhouse effect ?every day , solar radiation reaches surface planet sun . converted thermal radiation absorbed atmospheric greenhouse gases ( carbon dioxide ) re-radiated directions . known greenhouse effect , process essential life know . without , earth ’ surface temperature would significantly lower many life forms would cease exist . however , human agency involved , effect shown downside . indeed , excess amounts greenhouse gases put atmosphere , natural warming effect boosted point damaging , even disastrous consequences life earth . process known enhanced greenhouse effect , natural process warming caused solar radiation greenhouse gases heightened anthropogenic ( i.e . human ) factors .effect co2 greenhouse gases global climate first publicized 1896 swedish scientist svante arrhenius . first developed theory explain ice ages , well first scientist speculate changes levels carbon dioxide atmosphere could substantially alter surface temperature earth . expanded upon mid-20th century guy stewart callendar , english steam engineer inventor also interested link increased co2 levels atmosphere rising global temperatures . thanks research field , link two came known time “ callendar effect ” . 20th century rolled , scientific consensus emerged recognized phenomenon reality increasingly urgent problem . relying ice core data , atmospheric surveys performed nasa , mauna loa observatory countless research institutes planet , scientists believe direct link human agency rise global mean temperatures fifty even two-hundred years . due largely increased production co2 fossil fuel burning activities cement production tropical deforestation . addition , methane production also successfully linked increase global temperatures , result growing consumption meat need clear large areas tropical rainforests order make room pasture land .according latest assessment report intergovernmental panel climate change released 2007 , “ observed increase globally averaged temperatures since mid-20th century likely due observed increase anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations ” . left unchecked , unclear exact consequences would , scenarios predict steep drop worldwide food production , widespread drought , glacial depletion , near total depletion polar ice cap , possibility process could become irreversible . getting toasty !

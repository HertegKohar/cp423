''new horizons award given year early career researchers breakthrough prize foundation , prize money donated tech billionaires sergey brin , priscilla chan mark zuckerberg , yuri julia milner , anne wojcicki . second prize also awarded year alexandru lupsasca , vanderbilt university , michael johnson , harvard university work chasing mysterious black hole photon spheres .inside cosmological collideraccording standard model cosmology , universe began taking shape big bang , young cosmos swarmed particles matter antimatter , popped existence annihilate upon contact . universe 's building blocks wiped way . done completely , galaxies , stars , planets would formed .yet universe saved tiny perturbations rapidly expanding fabric space-time , enabled pockets plasma survive . roiling particle-antiparticle broth young cosmos expanded , molten filaments moved outwards form interconnected soap-sud structure thin films surrounding countless , mostly empty voids .today , universe exists map earliest particle interactions , frozen time along strands structures enormous cosmic web ( today birthing grounds galaxies ) . web 's form hints mysterious , primordial forces shaped .`` imagine taking large hadron collider cern scaling factor trillion trillion trillions , sort particle collider actually operating early universe , '' oliver philcox , told live science . `` anything weird happens , 's going affect distribution matter . ''detecting matter big bang reveal early particle interactions occurred inflation followed , moment universe expanded exponentially fast mere fraction second . view galaxies petrified remains earliest moments , search hints particle physics super early universe , philcox said .`` sometimes called 'cosmological collider ' — like particle collider scale whole universe , '' philcox added .recently , owing theoretical well experimental limitations , physicists studying universe evolved mainly focused cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) — leftover radiation big bang exists 2d image burned every corner sky . explained simple theorem , including linear terms , called cosmological perturbation theory .however , growing ability map universe 's cosmic web desire understand mysterious phenomena dark matter dark energy ( neither explained current cosmology ) driven physicists look large scale structures web directly .dot-mapping cosmic hurricaneyet astronomical cartography structures enormous hard . galaxies produced complicated astrophysical processes sculpted universe 's expansion collapse matter .instance , large structures get close , non-linear effects virialization ( gravitational objects spiral stable orbit ) take hold . far away , relativistic effects expansion universe warp space-time , also disrupting linear equations .`` good analogy could water waves . universe ocean , cmb fluctuations tiny ripples surface . galaxy would tsunami , hurricane , '' mikhail ivanov told live science . `` water ripples easily described within basic fluid dynamics developed centuries ago . , essence , cosmological perturbation theory . hurricane impossible describe pen paper , run expensive computer simulations , highly uncertain . ''skirt mathematical headwinds , researchers contributing theory called effective field theory ( eft ) large scale structures , well building several statistical tools help analyze galaxies interact .linear equations describe early universe break ends cosmic scale , eft smooths picture simplifying galaxies dots , viewing positions cosmos right distance two best descriptions gravity ( newtonian mechanics general relativity ) applicable minor adjustments .theorists working eft compared viewing pointillist painting : set order magnitude view universe see clearly — close small-scale chaos , far relativistic warping .given physicists powerful new tool view cosmos , enabling make testable predictions earliest beginnings .`` new ideas generate new science cases future galaxy surveys , '' marko simonović told live science . `` new data start arriving coming years , certainly exciting see learn universe beyond already know surprises waiting us along way .

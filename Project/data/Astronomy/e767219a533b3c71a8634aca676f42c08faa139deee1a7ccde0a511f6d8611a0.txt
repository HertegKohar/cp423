could get material moon shocking lightninglately , plenty ideas floating around methods mine moon . undoubtedly partly due growing enthusiasm artemis , nasa ’ lunar exploration program , planned support long-term human presence moon . would make best technique get valuable material lunar surface ? zapping lightning ? idea behind nasa institute advanced concepts grant given dr. amelia grieg university texas el paso . seems work .technique , formally known “ ablative mining , ” similar methods ’ covered , redirecting sun vaporize lunar regolith capture collection system . however , experiments downsides , leaving blackened layer melted regolith surface .ablative techniques ’ suffer downsides . underlying idea put circle hold two electrodes either side force enough charge electrodes create arc . regolith path arc ( basically lightning ) would immediately ionized turn constituent ions ( iron , oxygen , silicon three common ) .electrodes would attached rover specially designed optical systems focus flow free-standing ions narrow channel . free-flowing ions subjected magnetic fields , separate heavier ions lighter ones . ushered container specially designed hold specific ion . full containers easily offloaded ionizing rover transported back centralized base , rover also loaded new container .sounds relatively simple , concept , . uses many underlying techniques lunar regolith mining ideas . however , ablation process , though energy-intensive , likely one effective ways separating lunar regolith constituent components .effective would subject work part niac grant . dr. grieg purchased regolith simulant stuck couple electrodes . tinkering , able consistently produce arc two electrodes regolith simulant , thereby ionizing part regolith . publicly available sources , ’ unclear much regolith simulant turned usable ions , seems like viable next step research pipeline project , dr. grieg mentions explanatory video niac .fraser discusses concept isru .also estimates would possible mine around 10,000 kgs regolith per year four full-sized rovers . could enough support small base raw materials needs certain parts moon ( south pole , significant water reserves ) ., project ’ appear received phase ii niac grant , dr. greig seems joined blue origin manager , ’ unclear ’ able continue research idea . part niac develops ideas certain point , one things pride ut bringing people ’ attention unique ones . shocking lunar surface lightning certainly passes test .

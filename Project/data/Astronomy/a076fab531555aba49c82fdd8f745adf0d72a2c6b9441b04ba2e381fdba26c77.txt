icy `` rain '' saturn 's rings heating gas giant 's atmosphere , phenomenon never seen solar system , new study suggests .unexpected discovery , came result examining data collected various space missions including nasa 's hubble space telescope , retired cassini probe voyager 1 voyager 2 spacecraft , could help researchers predict exoplanets ring systems .telltale evidence newfound phenomenon takes form spectral line light saturn , represents hot hydrogen gas giant 's atmosphere . radiation `` bump '' indicates something contaminating atmosphere heating outside .plausible explanation heating , study team members said , icy particles raining rings saturn , carrying energy heats planet 's atmosphere collisions particles .raining particles may fall rings blasted solar ultraviolet radiation , micrometeorites particles solar wind . alternatively , electromagnetic forces could pulling charged dust particles rings . shaken loose , particles drawn tremendous gravity saturn toward planet .particle rain observed cassini probe plunged gas giant 's atmosphere end mission september 2017. new study reveals fresh insights process .`` though slow disintegration rings well known , influence atomic hydrogen planet surprise , '' study lead author lotfi ben-jaffel , institute astrophysics paris lunar planetary laboratory university arizona , said statement ( opens new tab ) .`` everything driven ring particles cascading atmosphere specific latitudes , '' ben-jaffel added . `` modify upper atmosphere , changing composition , also collisional processes atmospheric gases probably heating atmosphere specific altitude . ''research team reached conclusions looking ultraviolet-light ( uv ) observations five space missions studied saturn years . two voyager probes buzzed gas giant 1980s , measuring uv radiation researchers time dismissed noise . , years arrived saturn 2004 , cassini measured uv data atmosphere gas giant . observations combined additional data hubble multinational international ultraviolet explorer , launched earth orbit 1978 .ensure uv data accurate represented actual physical phenomenon saturn , team turned measurements made space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) instrument aboard hubble . data allowed researchers calibrate archival uv observations .`` everything calibrated , saw clearly spectra consistent across missions . possible reference point , hubble , rate transfer energy atmosphere measured decades , '' ben-jaffel said . `` really surprise . plotted different light distribution data together , realized , wow — 's . ''team use data follow uv levels location across saturn , points steady `` ice rain '' saturn 's rings best explanation observations .`` beginning ring characterization effect upper atmosphere planet . eventually want global approach would yield real signature atmospheres distant worlds , '' ben-jaffel said . `` one goals study see apply planets orbiting stars . call search 'exo-rings .

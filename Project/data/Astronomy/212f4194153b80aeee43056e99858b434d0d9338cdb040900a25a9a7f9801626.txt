solar physics : study ? teach us finding life beyond earth ?universe today investigated importance studying impact craters , planetary surfaces , exoplanets , astrobiology , disciplines teach researchers public finding life beyond earth . , discuss fascinating field solar physics ( also called heliophysics ) , including scientists study , benefits challenges studying , teach us finding life beyond earth , upcoming students pursue studying solar physics . , important study solar physics ?prof maria kazachenko , solar astrophysicist assistant professor astrophysical & planetary science department university colorado , boulder , tells universe today , “ solar physics studies sun works , sun star . understand home star works various reasons . first , stars building blocks universe . even made stardust . second , sun provides energy life affects life earth ( space weather , digital safety , astronauts ’ safety ) . , safe need understand star . finally , sun star could obtain high-quality maps magnetic fields , define stellar activity . summarize , studying sun fundamental space safety understanding universe . ”field solar physics dates 1300 bc babylonia , astronomers documented numerous solar eclipses , greek records show egyptians became proficient predicting solar eclipses . additionally , ancient chinese astronomers documented total 37 solar eclipses 720 bc 480 bc , along keeping records observing visible sunspots around 800 bc , well . sunspots first observed several international astronomers using telescopes 1610 , including galileo galilei , whose drawings kept day .presently , solar physics studies conducted ground- space-based telescopes observatories , including national science foundation ’ ( nsf ) daniel k. inouye solar telescope located hawai ’ nasa ’ parker solar probe , latter coming within 7.26 million kilometers ( 4.51 million miles ) sun ’ surface september 2023. history scientific instruments , benefits challenges studying solar physics ?prof. kazachenko tells universe today scientific benefits studying solar physics include “ abundant observations many science problems work ; benefits cross-disciplinary research ( stellar physics , exoplanets communities ) ” scientific challenges stemming need use remote sensing , sometimes resulting data misinterpretation . regarding professional aspects , prof. kazachenko tells universe today benefits include “ small friendly community , large variety research problems relying amazing new observations complex simulations , ability work different types problems ( instrumentation , space weather operation , research ) ” professional challenges including finding permanent employment , notes “ like everywhere science ” .image sun obtained nasa ’ solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) june 20 , 2013 , solar flare discharging left side . ( credit : nasa/sdo )noted , study solar physics involves investigating space weather , solar wind interacts earth , specifically magnetic field , resulting beautiful auroras observed high northern southern latitudes . occasion , solar wind strong enough wreak havoc satellites even knock power grids across earth ’ surface . demonstrated carrington event september 1-2 , 1859 , fires telegraph stations reported across globe , along several strong aurora observations , well . event occurred earth ’ magnetic field largely deflecting incoming solar wind , life planet could doomed without magnetic field protecting us . therefore , solar physics teach us finding life beyond earth ?prof. kazachenko tells universe today , “ sun tell us stellar activity , including flares coronal mass ejections might crucial creation life planets . frequent flares ? strong could ? flares eruptive ( leaving star ) others confined ( keeping erupted plasma star ) ? observe mostly confined flares stars ? sun could also tell us science behind long-term stellar evolution ( stellar cycles , stellar dynamo ) . ”like scientific disciplines , solar physics encompasses researchers myriad backgrounds , including aforementioned exoplanet communities , also includes standard physics , astrophysics , computer science , plasma physics , fluid dynamics , name . constant collaborative innovative efforts backgrounds researchers study sun , suns solar systems throughout cosmos . therefore , advice prof. kazachenko offer upcoming students wish pursue studying solar physics ?“ brave , ambitious , work hard , ” prof. kazachenko tells universe today . “ talk students scientists work field afraid contact scientists would like work . work math communication skills . ”noted , solar eclipses important facet studying solar physics , observed documented thousands years myriad civilizations across globe . holy grail eclipses total solar eclipses , moon completely blocks sun , offering solar physicists rare opportunity observe study coronal mass ejections , prof. kazachenko mentions could vital creation life . upcoming total solar eclipse cross united states couple months provide scientists even greater opportunities study sun ’ many attributes , even 2017 total solar eclipse . upcoming eclipse , prof. kazachenko plans lead expedition “ eclipses en la frontera ” eagle pass , tx , national solar observatory ’ education & public outreach team .prof. kazachenko tells universe today , “ wonderful time annular solar eclipse ( october 2023 ) , coming back totality ! ”prof. kazachenko ( left center ) cu boulder graduate student , marcel corchado-albelo ( center ) , participating educational workshop solar research sacred heart catholic elementary school annular solar eclipse october 2023 uvalde , tx .

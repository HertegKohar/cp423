ouch . canadarm2 took direct hit micrometeoriteliving space comes risks . astronauts international space station ( iss ) , risks occasionally make intrusively apparent .earlier month , european space agency astronaut andreas mogensen snapped photo canadarm2 , damage micrometeorite impact clearly visible .“ hole made 2021 , 1 mm object , traveling 25,000 km/h relative space station hit robotic arm . fortunately , critical components damaged , ” said mogensen social media .impact punched arm ’ thermal blanket impacted boom . robotic arm , service iss twenty years , continues function normally .iss ’ always lucky . october , nauka science module suffered damage similar micrometeorite impact , causing 72 litres coolant leak module ’ radiator space . determining leaking coolant might contaminate astronauts ’ spacesuits , spacewalk planned october 12th postponed . mogensen , alongside nasa astronaut loral ’ hara , scheduled recover science samples station exterior , tests ongoing measure ability resilient microbial life survive space . addition , pair expected carry variety exterior maintenance activities , including camera replacements jumper cable installations .spacewalk occur january february 2024 .canadarm micrometeorite impact : esa/nasa-a.mogensen .decades-long history , iss far avoided serious damage pressurized modules . station ability maneuver harm ’ way case close approach known piece space debris . evasive actions occurred regularly throughout iss ’ operations , occurring cadence twice per year ( thrice recent years ) .challenge knowing debris might collision course .ground-based orbital debris tracking programs currently monitor 33,000 pieces known space debris . smaller pieces debris micrometeorites tracked earth , station relies shielding protect . multi-layered structure known whipple shielding disperses force impact wider area , preventing depressurization .also technology demonstration tests works on-orbit debris trackers , able detect much smaller pieces debris ( small 3 cm ) .meantime , astronauts like mogensen stay ready worst-case scenario . carefully planned regimen emergency procedures one way space agencies try minimize risks .“ modules shielding smaller impacts , strong enough withstand impacts larger ones , ” says mogensen . “ repeatedly practice emergency scenarios , including depressurization . ”mogensen stay orbit february 2024 , return earth four crewmates spacex dragon capsule . mogensen ’ second mission space .

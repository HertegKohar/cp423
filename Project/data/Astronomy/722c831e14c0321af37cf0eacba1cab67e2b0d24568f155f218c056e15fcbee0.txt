water content map valuable life-sustaining commodity across moon . ( image credit : li , et al. , 2023 )high-energy electrons located tail plasma around earth weathering moon , excitingly , seem given rise water across lunar surface .new findings , reached team researchers led shuai li , scientist university hawaii mānoa school ocean earth science technology , could also explain water gathers pockets across moon never see sunlight called permanently shaded regions ( psrs ) .knowledge water distribution concentration across moon ’ essential understanding earth 's natural satellite evolved , 's also important planning future prolonged crewed missions moon . water could harvested space explorers sustenance , also generate fuel used staging missions lunar surface . missions could use moon stepping stone exploration deeper solar system , including mars .li team ’ theory connects water moon magnetic bubble surrounds earth called magnetosphere . magnetosphere shields planet high-energy charged particles delivered sun solar wind .solar wind smacks magnetosphere , deforms magnetic shield , creating long magnetic tail side earth facing away sun , aka nightside planet . tail aptly called magnetotail . high-energy electrons ions solar wind ( earth ) form plasma sheet within magnetotail ., moon orbits earth , passes magnetotail . result , magnetosphere shields earth , magnetotail shields moon charged particles allowing light still reach lunar surface .`` provides natural laboratory studying formation processes lunar surface water , '' li said statement . `` moon outside magnetotail , lunar surface bombarded solar wind . inside magnetotail , almost solar wind protons , water formation expected drop nearly zero . ''team used data collected 2008 2009 moon mineralogy mapper ( mmm ) instrument onboard chandrayaan 1 spacecraft assess water formation changes moon passes magnetotail .`` surprise , remote sensing observations showed water formation earth ’ magnetotail almost identical time moon outside earth ’ magnetotail , '' li explained . `` indicates , magnetotail , may additional formation processes new sources water directly associated implantation solar wind protons . ''particular , li found radiation caused high-energy electrons magnetotail exhibits similar effects caused ions solar wind .li initially started thinking interaction magnetotail moon considering weathering processes lunar surface occur moon passes magnetic tail earth . revealed oxygen magnetotail rusts iron polar regions moon .`` altogether , finding previous findings rusty lunar poles indicate mother earth strongly tied moon many unrecognized aspects , '' li added .team intends follow discovery investigating plasma environment around moon water content lunar poles different points moon ’ passage magnetotail .work conducted part artemis program , , soon 2026 , also send artemis iii mission moon . endeavor meant return humanity moon first time 50 years send first woman first person color lunar surface .get space.com newslettercontact news offers future brandsreceive email us behalf trusted partners sponsorsby submitting information agree terms & conditions privacy policy aged 16 .robert lea science journalist u.k. whose articles published physics world , new scientist , astronomy magazine , space , newsweek zme science . also writes science communication elsevier european journal physics . rob holds bachelor science degree physics astronomy u.k. ’ open university . follow twitter @ sciencef1rst .

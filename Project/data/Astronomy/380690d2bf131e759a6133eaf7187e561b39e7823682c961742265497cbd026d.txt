since rover mission ended , propulsion module brought moon made detour , performing series complex maneuvers took tight lunar orbit back earth orbit . possible module still 100 kg fuel , allowing scientists conduct additional maneuvers experiments .right , propulsion module ( pm ) orbiting earth altitude 115,000 km ( 71,500 miles ) , well geostationary orbit . isro said mission team decided use available fuel propulsion module derive additional information future lunar missions . specifically , demonstration gave chance test mission operation strategies future sample return mission .graphic chandrayaan-3 lander separating propulsion module . credit : isro .pm busy productive mission . lunar orbit month , ’ taking easy . separation lander , pm operated on-board experiment , spectro-polarimetry habitable planet earth ( shape ) payload , designed observe earth . specifically , instrument also provided scientists engineers experience future missions research purpose study habitable planet-like features earth . observations used isro future studies exoplanets . additionally , special operation shape payload october 28 , 2023 solar eclipse .spacecraft precise orbit injection optimal burn maneuvers , amount leftover fuel meant engineers could even pm originally expected . pm commanded execute orbit-raising maneuver moon perform trans-earth injection burn , placed pm earth-bound orbit .isro said first orbit raising maneuver moon performed october 9 , 2023 raise apolune altitude 5,112 km 150 km . trans-earth injection ( tei ) maneuver performed october 13 , 2023 , orbit slowly raised , pm made four moon flybys departing moon november 10 .currently , propulsion module orbiting earth orbital period nearly 13 days , 27 degrees inclination . high orbit , isro said threat close approach operational earth orbiting satellites .isro said extra operations allowed plan execute trajectory maneuvers return moon earth , well develop software plan validate maneuvers . also planned executed gravity assisted flyby two celestial bodies , notably avoided uncontrolled crash moon ’ surface end life pm , met requirements creating debris moon .current high geostationary orbit chandrayaan-3 pm ’ final trick ? knows ? resourceful engineers might figure another way make use multi-purpose spacecraft .

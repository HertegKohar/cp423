boeing 's starliner spacecraft moved hazardous processing area hangar nasa 's kennedy space center florida . first crewed launch delayed indefinitely . ( image credit : nasa )boeing standing first-ever crewed launch starliner astronaut capsule nasa , possibly indefinitely , due safety issues spacecraft 's parachutes wiring discovered last week .starliner astronaut launch , already years behind schedule , recently targeted launch two nasa astronauts international space station july 21. , likely wo n't launch summer , may get ground year .`` 's feasible , certainly would n't want commit dates timeframes , '' mark nappi , boeing starliner program manager vice president , told reporters press conference thursday ( june 1 ) . `` need spend next several days understanding need go solve problems . ''two major safety issues driving latest delay , discovered last week in-depth reviews starliner certify spacecraft crewed flight , nappi said .first , boeing engineers discovered `` soft links '' used suspension lines starliner 's three main parachutes failure load limit actually lower previously thought . turns links , secure parachute lines anchor tethers capsule , handle load starliner one chute fails . able land safely two three chutes safety requirement nasa , nappi said .second safety issue boeing found pertains protective tape covering wiring harnesses throughout starliner capsule . tape , nappi said , flammable `` hundreds '' feet inside starliner .`` 's highly unlikely would go cut tape , '' nappi said , adding would likely cause potential damage . `` 're looking solutions would provide essentially another type wrapping existing tape vulnerable areas reduces risk fire hazard . ''boeing 's latest starliner delay follows string setbacks spacecraft . december 2019 , boeing 's first uncrewed test flight starliner failed reach proper orbit could rendezvous international space station planned . ultimately land earlier intended .follow-up nasa investigation ultimately tasked boeing make 80 different corrective actions address safety issues starliner spacecraft . company also launch repeat uncrewed test flight , successfully reached space station may 2022 series delays valve issues . flammable tape issue parachute soft links issue present flight , mission success , nasa officials said .meanwhile , two nasa astronauts — sunita williams butch wilmore — waiting training fly starliner 's first crewed flight , called crew flight test . start year , test flight targeted february , steadily slipped later later months since . 2021 , two nasa astronauts originally assigned fly starliner , nicole mann josh cassada , reassigned fly spacex 's dragon could complete missions . since done .recent meeting nasa 's aerospace safety advisory panel , experts raised concerns starliner 's readiness , particularly parachute certification since system flown uncrewed test flight certified crewed flight , according spacenews report .steve stich , nasa 's commercial crew program manager , said entire team feels pain yet another delay .`` would say everybody bit disappointed , '' stitch told reporters thursday , adding boeing nasa engineers discussed delay together meeting week . `` could see people ready go roll sleeves go see next steps . ''boeing one two commercial companies picked nasa fly astronauts international space station multibillion-dollar fixed-cost contracts agency 's commercial crew program . due fixed-cost agreements , boeing likely responsible additional costs due delays .nasa 's second pick commercial crew flights spacex , led elon musk , launching astronauts station falcon 9 rockets dragon capsules since 2020. date , spacex launched seven crewed flights nasa three private flights customers , recently ax-2 commercial flight station axiom space landed back earth tuesday ( may 30 ) .traffic international space station tightly packed next months , stich said , crew arrivals , departures cargo missions orbiting lab . boeing able solve parachute wiring issues next months , next window fly starliner crewed flight fall , added .boeing hook least seven crewed flights nasa , including crew flight test six operational astronaut missions , part nasa contract . despite repeated delays , nappi said boeing remains committed starliner spacecraft fulfilling nasa obligations .`` 've talking future starliner 're going move forward , '' nappi said . `` know 's growing pains developing vehicles flying vehicles ... part business kinds issues . ''nasa wants two different spacecraft available astronaut flights dependent single company fly astronauts space , stich added .`` nasa desperately needs second provider transportation , '' said . `` ultimate goal one spacex one boeing flight per year rotate station .

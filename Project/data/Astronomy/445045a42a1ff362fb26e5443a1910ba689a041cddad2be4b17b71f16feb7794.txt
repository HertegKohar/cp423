three new fast radio bursts discovered westerbork telescope shown pierced halo neighbouring triangulum galaxy . invisible electrons galaxy deform frbs . sharp , new , live images , astronomers could estimate maximum number invisible atoms triangulum galaxy first time . ( credit : astron/futselaar/van leeuwen )three fast radio bursts punched right nearby galaxyfast radio bursts ( frbs ) cosmic mysteries slowly surely revealing secrets . bright flashes light visible radio wave part spectrum usually last milliseconds fading away forever . come random locations across universe powerful see emanating billions light-years away .astronomers used newly upgraded radio telescope array find five new frbs discovered multiple bursts pierced right triangulum galaxy ( m33 ) . brief flashes lit gas inside m33 , allowing astronomers calculate maximum number otherwise invisible atoms .radio telescope array westerbork , netherlands operation since 1968 recently upgraded apertif radio transient system ( arts ) , includes new receivers new supercomputer . arts system specially designed scientists engineers work astron , netherlands institute radio astronomy .frbs among brightest explosions universe . bursts contain immense amounts energy , approximately ten trillion times annual energy consumption entire world population , according astron . frbs believed caused neutron stars black holes , others continue defy classification . , theories persist , ranging pulsars magnetars , even extraterrestrial communications .investigating flashes , astronomers hope better understand fundamental properties matter makes universe . studying flashes difficult . one knows sky next burst go , last millisecond .previously , radio telescopes could roughly indicate frb occurred . arts upgrades enables westerbork determine exact location frb accurately .“ demonstrated three frbs discovered skewered neighbour , triangulum galaxy ! ” said van leeuwen . “ thus able count many invisible electrons galaxy contains , first time . fantastic result . ”“ combination detection rate localization accuracy …thus marks new phase growing number bursts used probe universe , ” team wrote .continuing pinpoint sources study frbs , astronomers hope learn radio bursts , also mysterious dark matter dark energy makes 95 % universe .

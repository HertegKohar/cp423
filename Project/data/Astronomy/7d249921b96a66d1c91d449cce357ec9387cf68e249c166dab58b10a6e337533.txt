intuitive machines ' odysseus lander tipped moon 'spicy ' lunar landingprivate odysseus lander lunar surface , ways one .14-foot-tall ( 4.3 meters ) odysseus , built houston company intuitive machines , apparently settled side historic touchdown yesterday ( feb. 22 ) , mission team members said . n't panic — pioneering spacecraft still much alive .`` far , quite bit operational capability even though 're tipped , '' intuitive machines ceo co-founder steve altemus said press briefing today ( feb. 23 ) .`` 's really exciting us , 're continuing surface operations mission result , '' added .artist 's illustration intuitive machines ' odysseus lander moon planned configuration , compared apparent actual configuration ( inset , demonstrated model press briefing feb. 23 , 2024 ) . ( image credit : nasa tv )odysseus launched feb. 15 atop spacex falcon 9 rocket , carrying six nasa science instruments six private payloads toward moon . lander arrived lunar orbit six days later touched yesterday evening , 190 miles ( 300 kilometers ) moon 's south pole .first successful lunar landing american vehicle since end apollo era 1972 , first-ever private spacecraft .took quick thinking mission team pull .target landing time neared yesterday , odysseus ' handlers realized laser rangefinders n't working properly . implemented workaround get required altitude velocity data , pressing service experimental nasa instrument aboard odysseus called ndl ( `` navigation doppler lidar precise velocity range sensing ) . ''team delayed planned touchdown two hours make fix , required beam software patch odysseus mission control houston .`` quite spicy seven-day mission get moon , '' altemus said today .landing came little extra dash flavor well , team announced today . 're still analyzing data , 's pretty clear odysseus n't land vertically intended , altemus tim crain , intuitive machines co-founder cto , said today 's briefing .final descent , odysseus supposed traveling 2 mph ( 3.2 kph ) vertical direction 0 mph horizontally . data show actually moving roughly 6 mph ( 10 kph ) vertically 2 mph ( 3.2 kph ) horizontally , altemus said .offered theory happened : perhaps , coming slightly off-nominal speeds , odysseus caught one landing legs crevice piece lunar terrain .result , `` might fractured landing gear tipped gently , '' said .data needed team make full assessment . particularly revealing information could come another payload aboard odysseus : eaglecam , system built students embry-riddle aeronautical university supposed deploy lander descent photograph touchdown lunar surface .mission team decided keep eaglecam aboard landing , however , due navigational difficulties . 's still spacecraft , team plans deploy soon , hopefully getting good ground-level shots odysseus lies .like eaglecam , odysseus ' instruments important subsystems appear functional , altemus said .`` sun impinging solar arrays charging batteries , '' said . `` providing power spacecraft , 're 100 % state charge . 's fantastic . ''data suggest odysseus came within mile two target landing zone , patch relatively flat ground near crater called malapert , altemus added . precise touchdown spot could soon become clear ; nasa 's lunar reconnaissance orbiter snap photos area weekend , goes according plan .mission team gather , beam home , much data odysseus ' new home moon . lander 's electronics designed survive harsh cold lunar night , days numbered .`` know landing site , sun move beyond solar arrays , configuration , approximately nine days , '' crain said . `` best case scenario , 're looking another nine 10 days .

chime provides new insights mysterious fast radio burstsmysterious fast radio bursts ( frbs ) originating deep space may repeat offenders rather one-off events , new research using canadian facilities suggest .frbs transient pulses radio wavelengths lasting anywhere fraction millisecond three seconds long , difficult track source understand origins . one great form assistance , however , canadian facility known chime ( canadian hydrogen intensity mapping experiment ) .chime located dominion radio astrophysical observatory near pencticton , b.c . originally used mapping abundance location hydrogen sky . telescope arrow large , instantaneous field view ( roughly 200 square degrees ) large number frequencies monitor ( 400 800 mhz ) .range sensitivity telescope growing “ outrigger ” observatories added , means chime also useful fast-growing field : seeking understanding frbs .“ frbs exciting mystery ’ like solve … also nice applications well use study material location , ” participating author ziggy pleunis told spaceq . pluenis started working research phd student mcgill university . ( dunlap postdoctoral fellow dunlap institute astronomy astrophysics . )“ coming galaxies , sort far away , interact material , ” added . “ use measure density galaxies magnetic fields . ”new study , published astrophysical journal led mcgill ’ bridget c. andersen , narrows 25 repeating frbs detected september 2019 may 2021 , along 14 “ candidate ” repeating frbs team hopes studies examine wavelengths observatories . chime attributed key study ’ success due “ large field view , high sensitivity , daily surveying large area sky ” , study authors write .team used dataset chime detections obtained list potential candidates using clustering algorithm . next , “ contamination rate ” calculation employed rule unrelated events nearby , left smaller dataset potential repeaters subsequently verified using localization techniques .including previous published research chime , saw first light 2017 , observatory detected 46 confirmed repeating frbs perhaps many 60 repeaters looking candidate set . chime , great examining entire sky , precise comes pinpointing locations – difficulty arose confirming frbs repeating time .“ really careful saying source , ” pleunis said suspected repeaters , emphasized follow-up studies required . “ , may happen close – per se – coming different places universe . ”looking repeaters confirmed across radio observatories , five noted “ prolific ” authors – interestingly enough – come different types galaxies . authors describe quintet , mapped subarcsecond precision , coming respectively ” star-forming dwarf galaxy , disk galaxy , another star-forming dwarf galaxy , globular cluster , barred galaxy . ”frbs thus found across variety different environments , including prolific repeaters considering confirmed events . situation presents difficulties identifying conditions formed , authors caution , urging studies frbs possible .one key question study could narrow , given confirmation , would whether repeating frbs distinct populations non-repeating frbs . alternatively , may “ non-repeating ” frbs simply slow repeaters , producing one burst week less detected follow-up observations .“ [ study ] tells us bunch infrequent repeaters , ” pleunis said . “ means lot may eventually repeat look long enough . ”elizabeth howellspaceq 's associate editor well business science reporter , researcher consultant . recently received ph.d. university north dakota communications instructor instructor algonquin college .

tiny telescope revealing “ hot jupiter ” secretsrecent study presented week 2023 meeting american geophysical union discusses observations “ hot jupiters ” nasa-funded cubesat mission known colorado ultraviolet transit experiment ( cute ) . unlike exoplanet-hunting telescopes , whose sizes comparable small school bus , cute measures 36 centimeters ( 14 inches ) length , equivalent size cereal box . findings come members team , consists undergraduate graduate students , published overview paper cute astronomical journal january 2023 results cute observing wasp-189b astrophysical journal letters august 2023 .launched september 2021 , cute focused ultraviolet capabilities several hot jupiters better understand atmospheric escape occurs worlds since orbit close parent stars . example , wasp-189b orbital period 2.7 days , fraction 88 days mercury , innermost planet solar system , takes orbit sun . study , team used cute identify wasp-189b atmosphere escape mind-blowing rate 400 million kilograms ( 882 million pounds ) per second due scorching surface temperatures approximately 8,315 degrees celsius ( 15,000 degrees fahrenheit ) .video published days launch cute september 2021 discussing mission goals .additionally , wasp-189b located 325 light-years earth , demonstrates cute ’ incredible observational capabilities despite small size . using cute , currently orbiting 525 kilometers ( 326 miles ) earth ’ surface , astronomers hope gain greater insight formation evolution planets outside solar system .“ want understand solar system fits family solar systems universe , ” said dr. kevin france , cute principal investigator , associate professor department astrophysical planetary sciences cu boulder , lead author overview paper , co-author wasp-189b paper . “ means understanding big planets , small planets , ones could life ones definitely ’ t—and important physical processes operating planets . ”credit : european space agencywasp-189b likely promising example cute ’ incredible capabilities , cute team observed total seven hot jupiters , results exciting others . example , team observed mascara-4b , located approximately 557 light-years earth , kelt-9b , located approximately 667 light-years earth , team finding barely gas escaping “ somewhere middle ” , respectively . however , atmospheric escape ’ limited hot jupiters , better understanding phenomenon could help astronomers better understand evolution “ super-earths ” , well .“ ’ lot evidence suggests super earths begin planets size neptune large , puffy atmospheres , lose much mass left rocky core possibly thin atmosphere , ” said dr. france .despite promise teach astronomers hot jupiters escaping atmospheres , time use cute limited , currently scheduled re-enter earth ’ atmosphere sometime 2027 .else cute teach astronomers hot jupiters atmospheric escape next years , new insights astronomers learn unique worlds coming years decades ? time tell , science !

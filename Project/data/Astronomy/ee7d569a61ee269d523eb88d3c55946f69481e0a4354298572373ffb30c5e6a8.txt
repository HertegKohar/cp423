future mars helicopters could explore lava tubesexploration mars continues , many nations sending robotic missions search evidence past life learn evolution planet ’ geology climate . penning article , ten missions exploring red planet , combination orbiters , landers , rovers , one helicopter ( ingenuity ) . looking future , nasa space agencies eyeing concepts allow explore farther red planet , including previously inaccessible places . particular , considerable interest exploring stable lava tubes run beneath martian surface .tubes may treasure trove scientific discoveries , containing water ice , organic molecules , maybe even life ! even crewed mission proposals recommend establishing habitats within tubes , astronauts would sheltered radiation , dust storms , extreme conditions surface . recent study university politehnica bucuresti ( upb ) , team engineers described autonomous martian inspection drone ( mid ) inspired inginuity helicopter could locate , enter , study lava tubes detail .study conducted daniel betco sabina ciudin , two aerospace engineers university bucharest polytechnic , support petrisor valentin parvu , associate professor upb ’ department aerospace sciences . paper details concept , “ autonomous navigation martian inspection drone , ” recently appeared acta astronautica . , describe guidance , navigation , control operations could developed mid concept , would rely convolutional neural network ( cnn ) ensure autonomy .martian lava tubes first noticed viking orbiters , studied mars 1976 1980. images acquired missions revealed many features showed mars different place . included flow channels , basins , alluvial deposits indicated mars flowing water surface . presence lava tubes confirmed subsequent orbiters like mars odyssey , mars global surveyor ( mgs ) , mars express , mars reconnaissance orbiter ( mro ) , indicated geologically active past well .betco colleagues told universe today via email , many things make martian lava tubes appealing scientists . much like lava tubes moon , similarly large enough accommodate entire planetary bases ( even whole cities ) , includes natural radiation shielding protection elements :“ instances , predicted surface values reduced much 98 % . lava tubes particular interest astrobiology may preserve evidence life mars offering protection uv radiation . additionally , caves could serve refuge future human missions exploring mars . deeper locations within caves could utilized shield micrometeoroids heat insulator . ”also considerable research suggests lava tubes may contain water ice even martian life ( likely form hardy bacteria ) . makes lava tubes viable location astronaut habitats , astrobiology research , possibly permanent settlements . many mission concepts proposed exploring lava tubes , including networked rovers robotic snakes . however , ingenuity helicopter – technology demonstrator accompanied perseverancerover mars – effectively demonstrated aerial vehicles could best option exploring mars .betco colleagues indicated , includes lava tubes run beneath surface , would tricky rovers navigate . “ aerial vehicles well-suited lava cave exploration move direction three-dimensional space , allowing enter lava tube inspection , ” said . “ comparison , rover limited two dimensions would require highly complex configuration enter navigate within lava tube . ”using ingenuity helicopter touchstone , team produced design martian inspection drone ( mid ) . whereas ingenuity relies two coaxial rotors , vehicle octocopter configuration eight . vehicle also suite advanced scientific instruments inspecting cave lava tube interiors . weigh maximum 15 kg ( 33 lbs ) , making significantly heavier ingenuity – weighs 1.8 kg ( 4 lbs ) . describe , mid also rely autonomous navigation system ai ensure make decisions without human controllers :“ foldable mechanism proposed occupy smaller volume launch . autonomous navigation relies acquiring data sensors accelerometers , gyroscopes , altimeters , cameras , processing determine position attitude drone flight . another layer autonomy implemented mid ’ capability make decisions regarding next steps based trained convolutional neural network ( cnn ) model . model offers possibility detect inspect lava-tube entrances ( pits ) . ”looking future , clear aerial vehicles play significant role exploring extraterrestrial environments . includes nasa ’ dragonflymission , nuclear-powered quadcopter explore saturn ’ largest moon , titan ( starting 2034 ) . concepts , like solar-powered aircraft fleets balloons , considered possible means exploring cloud tops venus deploying sample-return drones surface . autonomous helicopter , said betco colleagues , could drastically expand future exploration efforts mars :“ work ’ potential implications lie efficient exploration martian planet , drone offers possibility survey inspect areas interest without requiring constant human intervention . development mid contributes integration artificial intelligence martian missions . even though technology quite ready , lessons learned technologies developed drastically benefit future exploration red planet . ”team currently working implementing new capabilities allow concept inspect insides lava tubes using simultaneous localisation mapping ( slam ) techniques . realized , similar concepts could used explore lava tubes recesses moon , mercury , anywhere else solar system found .

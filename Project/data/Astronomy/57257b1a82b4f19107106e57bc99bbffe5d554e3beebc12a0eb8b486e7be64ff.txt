cosmic microwave background ?thousands years , human contemplating universe seeking determine true extent . whereas ancient philosophers believed world consisted disk , ziggurat cube surrounded celestial oceans kind ether , development modern astronomy opened eyes new frontiers . 20th century , scientists began understand vast ( maybe even unending ) universe really .course looking farther space , deeper back time , cosmologists discovered truly amazing things . example , 1960s , astronomers became aware microwave background radiation detectable directions . known cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , existence radiation helped inform understanding universe began .description :cmb essentially electromagnetic radiation left earliest cosmological epoch permeates entire universe . believed formed 380,000 years big bang contains subtle indications first stars galaxies formed . radiation invisible using optical telescopes , radio telescopes able detect faint signal ( glow ) strongest microwave region radio spectrum .cmb visible distance 13.8 billion light years directions earth , leading scientists determine true age universe . however , indication true extent universe . given space state expansion ever since early universe ( expanding faster speed light ) , cmb merely farthest back time capable seeing .relationship big bang :cmb central big bang theory modern cosmological models ( lambda-cdm model ) . theory goes , universe born 13.8 billion years ago , matter condensed onto single point infinite density extreme heat . due extreme heat density matter , state universe highly unstable . suddenly , point began expanding , universe know began .time , space filled uniform glow white-hot plasma particles – consisted protons , neutrons , electrons photons ( light ) . 380,000 150 million years big bang , photons constantly interacting free electrons could travel long distances . hence epoch colloquially referred “ dark ages ” .universe continued expand , cooled point electrons able combine protons form hydrogen atoms ( aka . recombination period ) . absence free electrons , photons able move unhindered universe began appear today ( i.e . transparent permeated light ) . intervening billions years , universe continued expand cooled greatly .due expansion space , wavelengths photons grew ( became ‘ redshifted ’ ) roughly 1 millimetre effective temperature decreased absolute zero – 2.7 kelvin ( -270 °c ; -454 °f ) . photons fill universe today appear background glow detected far-infrared radio wavelengths .history study :existence cmb first theorized ukrainian-american physicist george gamow , along students , ralph alpher robert herman , 1948. theory based studies consequences nucleosynthesis light elements ( hydrogen , helium lithium ) early universe . essentially , realized order synthesize nuclei elements , early universe needed extremely hot .big bang timeline universe . cosmic neutrinos affect cmb time emitted , physics takes care rest evolution today . image credit : nasa / jpl-caltech / a. kashlinsky ( gsfc ) .theorized leftover radiation extremely hot period would permeate universe would detectable . due expansion universe , estimated background radiation would low temperature 5 k ( -268 °c ; -450 °f ) – five degrees absolute zero – corresponds microwave wavelengths . ’ 1964 first evidence cmb detected .result american astronomers arno penzias robert wilson using dicke radiometer , intended use radio astronomy satellite communication experiments . however , conducting first measurement , noticed excess 4.2k antenna temperature could account could explained presence background radiation . discovery , penzias wilson awarded nobel prize physics 1978 .initially , detection cmb source contention proponents different cosmological theories . whereas proponents big bang theory claimed “ relic radiation ” left big bang , proponents steady state theory argued result scattered starlight distant galaxies . however , 1970s , scientific consensus emerged favored big bang interpretation .1980s , ground-based instruments placed increasingly stringent limits temperature differences cmb . included soviet relikt-1 mission aboard prognoz 9 satellite ( launched july 1983 ) nasa cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) mission ( ’ findings published 1992 ) . work , cobe team received nobel prize physics 2006 .cobe also detected cmb ’ first acoustic peak , acoustical oscillations plasma corresponds large-scale density variations early universe created gravitational instabilities . many experiments followed next decade , consisted ground balloon-based experiments whose purpose provide accurate measurements first acoustic peak .second acoustic peak tentatively detected several experiments , definitively detected wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) deployed 2001. 2001 2010 , mission concluded , wmap also detected third peak . since 2010 , multiple missions monitoring cmb provide improved measurements polarization small scale variations density .future cmb :according various cosmological theories , universe may point cease expanding begin reversing , culminating collapse followed another big bang – aka . big crunch theory . another scenario , known big rip , expansion universe eventually lead matter spacetime torn apart .neither scenarios correct , universe continued expand accelerating rate , cmb continue redshifting point longer detectable . point , overtaken first starlight created universe , background radiation fields produced processes assumed take place future universe .

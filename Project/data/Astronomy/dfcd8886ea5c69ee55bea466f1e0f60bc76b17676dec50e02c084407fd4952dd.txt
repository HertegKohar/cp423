samples asteroid ryugu contain 20 amino acids2014 , japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) dispatched hayabusa2 spacecraft rendezvous 162173 ryugu , near-earth asteroid ( nea ) periodically passes close earth . 2018 , sample-return mission reached ryugu spent next year half studying surface obtaining samples surface subsurface . 2020 , samples made back earth , scientists began analyzing hopes learning early history solar system answering key questions origins life .earlier year , first results analysis showed ryugu ( expected ) rich carbon , organic molecules , volatiles ( like water ) hinted possibility comet . based recent analysis , eight teams japanese researchers ( including one jaxa ) recently announced ryugu carries strains less 20 different amino acids -the building blocks dna life ! findings could provide new insight life distributed throughout cosmos could mean common previously thought .investigation launched 2021 jaxa numerous japanese research institutions , including university tokyo hiroshima university . initially , analysis found evidence 10 types amino acids , number since grown 20. since c-type asteroids composed material left formation solar system , study ancient bodies could reveal things early history . samples asteroids found earth contained organic molecules , uncertain result contamination earth ’ biosphere .hayabusa2 ’ sample canisters . credit : yada ( et al . ) /nature astronomyone hayabusa2 mission ’ chief objectives determine link c-type asteroids carbonaceous chondrites ( cc ) meteorites . refers meteorites altered water , indicated presence clay minerals salts inside . time , scientists suspected meteorites come c-type asteroids originated far reaches outer solar system . asteroids , composed largely volatiles like water ice , believed introduced water inner solar system billions years ago .case ryugu samples , scientists looking answer longstanding question : c-type asteroids responsible distributing water building blocks life throughout solar system via cc meteorites ? per nebula hypothesis , planets coalesced ca . 4.5 billion years ago disk gas dust settled around newly-born sun . one theory suggests earth accreted disk , planet ’ surface molten state would destroyed amino acids . gradually , meteorites reintroduced earth surface cooled .theory correct , life earth emerged thanks organic material originate introduced asteroids outer solar system ( aka . lithopanspermia ) . hiroshi naraoka , planetary scientist kyushu university leader team , explained lunar planetary science conference march :“ detected various prebiotic organic compounds samples , including proteinogenic amino acids , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons similar terrestrial petroleum , various nitrogen compounds . prebiotic organic molecules spread throughout solar system , potentially interplanetary dust ruygu surface impact causes . ”hayabusa2 groundbreaking collected samples subsurface materials weathered sunlight cosmic rays . kensei kobayashi , professor emeritus astrobiology yokohama national university , also explained findings significant implications astrobiology . “ proving amino acids exist subsurface asteroids increases likelihood compounds arrived earth space , ” said , adding possible indication “ life could born places universe previously thought . ”hayabusa2 one handful existing proposed sample-return missions dedicated investigating origins life solar system . 2018 2021 , nasa ’ osiris-rex also collected samples nea bennu , returned earth september 2023. china also plans launch sample-return mission , known zhenghe , launch 2024 rendezvous nea kamo ’ oalewa 2032 .

gravitational lensing helping nail dark matteraccording widely-accepted cosmological model , majority mass universe ( roughly 85 % ) consists “ dark matter. ” elusive , invisible mass theorized interact “ normal ” ( “ visible ” ) matter gravity alone electromagnetic fields , neither absorbing emitting light ( hence name “ dark ” ) . search matter ongoing , candidate particles including weakly-interacting massive particles ( wimps ) ultralight bosons ( axions ) , opposite extremes mass scale behave differently ( theory ) .matter ’ existence essential predominant theories gravity ( general relativity ) particle physics ( standard model ) make sense . otherwise , may need radically rethink theories gravity behaves largest scales ( aka . modified gravity ) . however , according new research led university hong kong ( hku ) , study “ einstein rings ” could bring us step closer understanding dark matter . according paper , way dark matter alters curvature spacetime leaves signatures suggest could made axions !theories regarding dark matter emerged 1960s explain rotational curve galaxies , appear consistent amount visible matter contained . time , astronomers cosmologists noted distant galaxies universe ( background galaxies ) surrounded “ haloes ” matter . “ dark matter haloes ” bend amplify light around – phenomenon known gravitational lensing – produces features known “ einstein rings , ” “ einstein crosses , ” strange shapes patterns .effect predicted einstein ’ theory general relativity , presence massive objects alters curvature spacetime . studying rings lensed images distorted , astrophysicists hope learn properties dark matter . amruth explained universe today via email , colleagues specifically sought investigate prevailing theories types particles constitute dark matter ( dm ) :“ current paradigm dm wimps , weakly interacting massive particles , despite billions dollars funding , decades searching laboratory experiments , none detected . reason infer existence dm , however , accept general relativity correct theory gravity , astronomical observations require dm . velocity dispersion galaxy clusters , first proposed fritz zwicky 1930s , recently , phenomenon gravitational lensing . ”study , amruth colleagues looked several systems gravitational lenses caused light distant galaxies appear different places . particular , examined hs 0810+2554 , quadruply-lensed quasar appears us 9 billion years ago . using detailed modeling , calculated dm would distort light distant quasar based two leading candidate particles . said amruth :“ long-standing problem ( two decades ) astronomy so-called flux anomalies , brightnesses multiply lensed images background quasar agreement model predictions 30 % ! , first time , consider axionic ( wave ) dm , composed light particles , opposed massive wimps . ultralight particles unique properties , predicted first time full simulation 2014 . ”multiple images background image created gravitational lensing seen system hs 0810+2554 . credit : nasa/esaaddition opposite extremes terms mass , wimps , axions also thought behave radically different ways . whereas wimps predicted behave discrete particles , axions theorized behave like waves due quantum interference . based characteristics , team tested see candidate produced similar lenses ones observed around hs 0810+2554 background galaxies .“ paper , first time , use wave dark matter models ask : ‘ different would lensing observations look used ultralight ( axions ) instead ultramassive particles ( wimps ) ? ' ” amruth added . “ find wave dm indeed reproduce anomalies seen lensing observations , i.e . brightnesses positions multiply-lensed images ’ previously explained wimp models . ”wimps model conform team ’ observations , axion model accurately reproduced observed features system . demonstrating explain lensing anomalies astrophysical phenomena , results could bolster case axions leading dark matter candidate . although study ended debate form dark matter takes ( wimps axions ) whether even exists , presents new opportunities future testing experiment . amruth explained :“ axions gaining increasing traction strong contender dm . work really shown need seriously consider possibility axions , wimp models ’ explain lensing anomalies seen . ’ important put wave dm stringent tests , currently already working ! going another paper come soon explore effects wave dm explaining anomalous observations first lensed type ia supernova , finding indeed explain away anomalies whereas wimp models ! ”results build previous research pointed toward axions likely candidate dark matter . includes study published 2017 team mexican british astrophysicists used mass dwarf spheroid galaxies ( dsgs ) near milky way infer presence axions . 2018 , study led dunlap institute astronomy astrophysics showed light cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) could used probe axion dark matter .similar study recently conducted atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) collaboration , used background light cmb create new map dark matter distribution . existence nature dark matter enduring mystery , next-generation telescopes , instruments , observations helping astronomers narrow search . resulting improvement understanding immense implications cosmology , particle physics , understanding universe came .

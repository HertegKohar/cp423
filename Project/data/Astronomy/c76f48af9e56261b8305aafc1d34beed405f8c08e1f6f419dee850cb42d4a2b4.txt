'quantum superchemistry ' observed 1st time everquantum superchemistry observed researchers first time . ( image credit : getty images )first time , researchers observed `` quantum superchemistry '' lab .long theorized never seen , quantum superchemistry phenomenon atoms molecules quantum state chemically react rapidly atoms molecules different quantum states . quantum state set characteristics quantum particle , spin ( angular momentum ) energy level .observe new super-charged chemistry , researchers coax atoms , entire molecules , quantum state . , however , saw chemical reactions occurred collectively , rather individually . atoms involved , meaning greater density atoms , quicker chemical reactions went .`` saw lined theoretical predictions , '' cheng chin , professor physics university chicago led research , said statement . `` scientific goal 20 years , 's exciting era . ''`` saw lined theoretical predictions , '' cheng chin , professor physics university chicago led research , said statement . `` scientific goal 20 years , 's exciting era . ''team reported findings july 24 journal nature physics . observed quantum superchemistry cesium atoms paired form molecules . first , cooled cesium gas near absolute zero , point motion ceases . chilled state , could ease cesium atom quantum state . altered surrounding magnetic field kick chemical bonding atoms .atoms reacted quickly together form two-atom cesium molecules researchers conducted experiment normal , non-super-cooled gas . resulting molecules also shared quantum state , least several milliseconds , atoms molecules start decay , longer oscillating together .`` [ w ] ith technique , steer molecules identical state , '' chin said .researchers found though end result reaction two-atom molecule , three atoms actually involved , spare atom interacting two bonding atoms way facilitated reaction .could useful applications quantum chemistry quantum computing , molecules quantum state share physical chemical properties . experiments part field ultracold chemistry , aims gain incredibly detailed control chemical reactions taking advantage quantum interactions occur cold states . ultracold particles could used qubits , quantum bits carry information quantum computing , example .study used simple molecules , next goal attempt create quantum superchemistry complex molecules , chin said .`` far push understanding knowledge quantum engineering , complicated molecules , major research direction scientific community , '' said .get space.com newslettercontact news offers future brandsreceive email us behalf trusted partners sponsorsby submitting information agree terms & conditions privacy policy aged 16 .stephanie pappas contributing writer space.com sister site live science , covering topics ranging geoscience archaeology human brain behavior . previously senior writer live science freelancer based denver , colorado , regularly contributes scientific american monitor , monthly magazine american psychological association . stephanie received bachelor 's degree psychology university south carolina graduate certificate science communication university california , santa cruz .

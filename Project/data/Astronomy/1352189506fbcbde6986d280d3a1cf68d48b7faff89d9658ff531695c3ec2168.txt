interestingly , astronomers observed two black holes directly . first supermassive black hole m87 , second sag * , heart milky way . direct observations , know large black holes . black holes video ? , astronomers bit detective work . size black hole depends two things : mass rotation . , mass largest factor size , astronomers determine mass black hole good idea size .since ’ directly observe black holes , astronomers rely black holes affect environment around . direct way would look motion stars orbiting close black hole . orbital speed stars depends mass central black hole , orbital speed planets depends mass sun . first determined mass sag * . years observed motions nearby stars , told us sag * mass 4 million suns . direct observations later confirmed .possible within milky way . galaxies distant us observe individual stars orbiting central black hole . fortunately , ways determine black hole ’ mass . one known [ reverberation mapping ] https : //briankoberlein.com/post/massive-speed/ . galactic black hole active , gas close black hole emit tremendous amount energy . since gas orbiting black hole , light gas orbiting away us redshifted , region orbiting toward us blue-shifted . broadens spectral lines emitted gas , amount broadening depends orbital speed gas . astronomers determine mass , observing stars orbiting sag * .course , works black hole active . ’ astronomers use different measure known m-sigma relation . gravitational effect black hole strongest near event horizon , still tugs objects far away well . astronomers look stars within central bulge galaxy , measure overall average speed . galaxies , average speed bulge stars proportional mass central black hole . faster bulge stars , massive black hole . relation , astronomers get good measure black hole ’ mass .far , largest black hole know beast known ton 618 , massive 40 billion suns . ’ large astronomers ’ sure got massive . ’ huge astronomers considered ultramassive black hole rather mere supermassive one . still great deal learn black holes , least know big many .

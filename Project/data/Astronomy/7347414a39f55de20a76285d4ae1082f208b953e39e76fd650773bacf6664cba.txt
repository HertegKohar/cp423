astronomers discovered galaxy cluster important characteristic ; 's “ relaxed , meaning shows signs disrupted violent collisions clusters galaxies . composite image contains x-rays chandra ( blue ) ,

galaxy cluster totally relaxed , unharassed billion yearsspan human lifetime , much universe seems unchanging . ’ illusion ; things always changing , fact make galaxies clusters reside unruly places due mergers collisions .however , galaxy clusters seem much calmer others .galaxy clusters staggering structures contain hundreds individual galaxies , along vast clouds gas huge quantities dark matter . milky way galaxy part virgo supercluster , contains 100 clusters galaxy groups . virgo supercluster part laniakea supercluster . nested structures inevitably compared matryoshka dolls .galaxy clusters grow time mergers individual galaxies , groups , even clusters . chaotic process leaves mark resulting clusters .clusters considered “ relaxed , ” meaning show signs mergers . scientists recently found distant relaxed cluster yet , named spt2215 . ’ 8.4 billion light years away , astronomers seeing universe 5.3 billion years old . astronomers found relaxed galaxy clusters , never far away never ancient .“ , seen relaxed galaxy cluster distant spt2215 , ” said michael calzadilla massachusetts institute technology ( mit ) , lead author paper cluster . paper recent three papers covering discovery different key properties cluster clusters .’ surprising find relaxed cluster epoch universe . ’ clusters grow mergers collisions , clusters going messy process way growing large . cluster massive contains 700 trillion solar masses material , meaning experienced mergers .several things spt2215 indicate ’ calm , calm quite time .relaxed clusters also called ‘ cool core clusters. ’ case , massive galaxy lies center spt2215 . ’ evidence prodigious star formation going center galaxy , near galaxy ’ supermassive black hole . star formation take place , gas near center cool enough . ’ hot , stars form . typically , black hole outbursts keep gas near center hot star formation occur . reason , black hole calm .“ extreme cooling sfr < star formation rate > spt2215 rare among known cool core clusters , even remarkable observe high redshift clusters still dynamically disturbed , ” authors explain first paper .“ seems like black hole spt2215 quiet enough let star formation flourish , ” said michael mcdonald , also mit , co-author three papers .another one spt2215 ’ unusual features single galaxy lies center . galaxies within 600,000 light-years bright extended .

cluster ’ mysterious side , tell astrophysicists something ongoing issue astrophysics : role black hole feedback plays star formation .supermassive black hole actively accretes material emits powerful

history , ” said lindsey bleem u.s. department energy ’ argonne national laboratory . bleem colleagues first reported spotting cluster 2020 , first three new papers . “ yet fact relaxed suggests opposite . would like finding tidy kitchen right dinner rush . ”new observations dovetail observations james webb space telescope . jwst looked back time universe ’ early galaxies found ’ much fully formed much earlier thought . jwst observations led one researcher suggest universe actually much older thought : twice old , fact , though paper suggested ’ gained much traction .somehow , ’ misunderstood quickly galaxies formed evolved clusters ’ part grew massive quickly . observations spt2215 make us question understanding even .relaxed clusters play another role understanding cosmos . ’ signposts used mark measure expansion universe cause , dark energy .“ relaxed clusters like spt2215 one signposts used measure expansion universe , ” said adam mantz stanford university , first reported spt2215 ’ relaxed status using chandra data 2022 , second paper . “ adding distant objects like sample relaxed clusters allows us better constrain acceleration cosmic expansion , properties

giant black hole destroyed star threw pieces spaceblack hole consumes star , things get quite messy . take , example , event known asassn-14li , massive star strayed close supermassive black hole paid ultimate price .two main dangers posed black hole . first possess event horizon . mass curves space black holes contain much mass small space spacetime folds creating cosmic trap . anything crosses event horizon lost forever . second threat tidal forces .body approaches dense mass planet , star , black hole , part closest mass pulled slightly strongly part furthest mass . gravity tries squeeze body oval egg shape rather sphere . since forces earth moon cause ocean tides , known tidal forces . normally tidal forces rather small , near dense massive objects black hole tidal forces powerful rip apart objects , causing known tidal disruption event ( tde ) .star approaches black hole , tidal forces typically rip star apart well reaches event horizon . much star consumed black hole depends original trajectory star . case asassn-14li , star ’ consumed black hole . tde ripped star apart superheated remains , emitted powerful x-rays ultraviolet light . bad news star , great news astronomers .spectrum taken tde . credit : miller , et alnasa ’ chandra x-ray observatory esa ’ xmm-newton telescope captured x-ray spectra event , observations observatories provided uv spectra . together , gave astronomers detailed look composition doomed star . recent work , team able analyze spectra material captured orbit around black hole gasses streamed away black hole . comparing things abundances nitrogen carbon stellar debris , team able confirm star mass 3 suns .earlier year , astronomers observed another tde named scary barbie could 14 solar mass star , estimate based overall brightness event , spectra . asassn-14li currently largest tde confirmed mass .event powerful example stars near supermassive black hole . events , may even able study clustering stars around supermassive black holes galaxies , would help us understand central cores galaxies evolve role play stellar evolution .

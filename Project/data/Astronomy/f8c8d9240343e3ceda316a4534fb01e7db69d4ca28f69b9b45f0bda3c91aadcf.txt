’ well-known fact among astronomers astrophysicists roughly half stars milky way reside binary systems . knowing multiple star systems form essential understanding galactic evolution , planetary formation , emergence life . widely accepted theory regarding star formation ( nebular hypothesis ) states stars form densest regions molecular clouds ( aka . “ dense core ” ) . theory accounts individual star systems well , mechanisms drive formation multi-star systems yet well understood .currently thought multiple star systems form via fragmentation cloud cores early evolution , observations historically lacking . investigate mystery , almasop team examined 72 young cold cores gmcs orion constellation thermal emissions corresponding wavelength 1.3 mm – extremely high frequency ( ehf ) range . observing dense cold core orion b gmc 1,500 light-years earth ( designated g206.93-16.61e2 ) , observed system four stellar objects .consisted two protostars two gas concentrations likely undergo gravitational collapse near future . observed largest separation four objects system 1,000 astronomical units ( aus ) , 33 times distance sun neptune ( 30 aus ) . stands contrast last time quadruple system observed 2015 another international team using alma . case , discovery team observed young protostar three gravitationally-bound dense gas clouds would form new stars ~40,000 years .case , however , quadruple system observed wide separation far greater 1,000 astronomical units ( aus ) . dust emission spectra also revealed several elongated ribbon-like structures bound four objects together extended outwards . determine role played structures , team conducted numerical simulation compared similar quadruple system one observed . based results , team theorizes extended ribbons could “ funnels ” transport gas core ’ outer envelope protesters connect newborn stars .said luo qiu-yi , ph.d. student shao first author study :“ exceptional compactness close-proximity system fascinating discovery . analysis suggests system likely form gravitationally bound quadruple star system future . explanation gas outflows propagate might entangled gas accretion processes system members . study highlights complicated interactions among members forming higher-order star system . ”“ simulation supports ribbons serve large-scale accretion streamers , ” added prof. liu . “ thus , two gas condensations system potential form star relying feeding continuum ribbons . accretion streamers could also fragment , form new stars . ”last , observations revealed intricate gas outflows caused stellar winds generated protostars system , causing accreting gas dust lost . similar observed around active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , winds generated supermassive black hole ( smbh ) push material galactic center , could impact evolution system . future observations using alma millimeter/submillimeter observatories , scientists hope reveal details multi-star systems formation process .

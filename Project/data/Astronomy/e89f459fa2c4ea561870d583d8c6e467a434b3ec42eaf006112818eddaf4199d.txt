runaway supermassive black hole ejected galaxy , possibly tussle two black holes , trailed 200,000 light-year-long chain infant stars , new study reports .incredible sight , like nothing astronomers spotted , identified hubble space telescope happy accident .supermassive black hole , mass equivalent 20 million suns , traveling fast would cover distance earth moon 14 minutes .illustration runaway black hole ejected host galaxy followed trail infant stars . ( image credit : nasa , esa , leah hustak ( stsci ) )travels , cosmic runaway piling gas front . dense regions gas like left wake rogue black hole collapse , new stars born . supermassive black hole cruising clouds gas would normally feed , process called accretion . runaway cosmic monster moving fast grab bite .result , rogue black hole actively creating corridor infant stars , forming tail tracks right back supermassive black hole 's galaxy origin , researchers said . tail half bright galaxy , meaning must absolutely brimming stars .`` think 're seeing wake behind black hole gas cools able form stars . , 're looking star formation trailing black hole , '' study lead author pieter van dokkum , yale university , said statement ( opens new tab ) . `` 're seeing aftermath . like wake behind ship , 're seeing wake behind black hole . n't look like anything 've seen . ''outermost tip column stars knot ionized oxygen incredibly bright . team believes result black hole striking gas , shocking heating .`` gas front gets shocked supersonic , very-high-velocity impact black hole moving gas , '' said van dokkum . `` works exactly really known . ''something else n't totally clear yet supermassive black hole came launched host galaxy .kicked cosmic cuckooteam thinks ejected black hole could escaped host galaxy result multiple collisions supermassive black holes , first occurring two galaxies merged 50 million years ago , bringing two cosmic titans close together .supermassive black holes circled around , another galaxy entered mix , carrying another supermassive black hole . following old adage `` two 's company three 's crowd , '' interaction three black holes chaotic led one black hole stealing momentum others hurtling space .means 's good chance interloper black hole introduced system eventually replaced one original black holes , like cosmic cuckoo .runaway black hole blasted away former companions , new pairing would moved opposite direction . hints runaway black-hole binary opposite side host galaxy black hole racing space stellar tail .scientists hoping good fortune experienced van dokkum team initially made extraordinary observation massive cosmic runaway .`` pure serendipity stumbled across , '' van dokkum concluded . `` scanning hubble image , noticed little streak . immediately thought , 'oh , cosmic ray hitting camera detector causing linear imaging artifact .

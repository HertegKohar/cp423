artist 's concept based hubble space telescope images gas-and-dust disks around newborn star tw hydrae . hst images show shadows sweeping across disks encircling system . shadows probably slightly inclined inner disks block starlight reaching outer disk . disks slightly inclined due gravitational pull unseen planets warping disk structure . credits artwork : nasa , aura/stsci esa , leah hustak ( stsci )newborn star surrounded planet-forming disks different anglesone great questions solar system : like formed ? know protosolar nebula birthed sun planets . , know planets solar system slightly different orbital inclinations , probably due interesting dynamics birth crèche . ? answer may slightly weird-looking protoplanetary disk circling newborn star tw hydrae .stellar infant lies 200 light-years away earth . astronomers using hubble space telescope ( hst ) data looking massive disk gas dust circling star . , hst found something wonky : least two , possibly three “ sub ” disks . , may least two planets , possibly three forming . interactions disks planetary objects warping disks casting shadows .system first drew attention 2017 astronomers saw shadow sweeping across face protoplanetary disk system surrounding star . appears inner larger outer disk . shadow ’ come planet . instead , ’ cast outer disk inner one . interestingly , ’ least one possible planets pulling gas dust disk toward .images , taken year apart nasa/esa hubble space telescope , reveal shadow moving counterclockwise around gas dust disc encircling young newborn star tw hydrae . shadow may caused gravitational effect unseen planet orbiting close star . planet pulls material main disc , creating warped inner disc . twisted disc blocks light star casts shadow onto disc ’ outer region .wait ! ’ another shadow !, looks like ’ additional shadow . might another disk inside system , along possible planets . , gives astronomers clue solar system looked like 4.5 billion years ago . second shadow showed observations obtained june 6 , 2021 , part multi-year program designed track shadows circumstellar disks . astronomer john debes space telescope science institute compared tw hydrae disk hubble observations made several years ago .“ found shadow done something completely different , ” said . “ first looked data , thought something gone wrong observation ’ expecting . flummoxed first , collaborators like : going ? really scratch heads took us actually figure explanation . ”explanation invokes two misaligned disks casting shadows . first observation missed pair pretty close together . however , years observations , ’ separated split two shadows . apparently , two misaligned disks way thanks gravitational pull two planets slightly different orbital planes . “ ’ never really seen protoplanetary disk . makes system much complex originally thought , ” said debes .newborn star tw hydraenewborn star interesting infant system . ’ called “ tauri ” star . ’ ’ part class variables older 10 million years . astronomers consider “ pre-main-sequence ” star . ( meaning ’ started nuclear fusion formed radiative zone ) . many stellar class reside near giant molecular clouds . ’ typically youngest stars quite active .tw hydrae fits category really well . ’ 80 percent mass sun slightly larger star . astronomers think ’ around 8 10 million years old . protoplanetary disk region surrounding feeding newborn star apparently also forming planets . tw hydrae one member larger collection young stars called “ tw hydrae association . ”racecar planets protoplanetary diskdisk structures inside tw hydrae ’ protoplanetary disk could related action planets lapping orbit . “ suggest two planets fairly close , ” debes said . “ one moving much faster , would noticed earlier observations . ’ like two race cars close , one slowly overtakes laps , ” said debes .suspected planets located region roughly distance jupiter sun . , shadows complete one rotation around star every 15 years . ’ equal orbital period planet distance .two inner disks inclined five seven degrees relative plane outer disk . comparable range orbital inclinations inside solar system . “ right line typical solar system style architecture , ” said debes .future studiesobviously , given closely mimics astronomers suspect happened solar system , hst telescopes , atacama large millimeter array , continue study tw hydrae system . outer disk shadows falling may extend quite far away . scientists suggest could stretch far several times radius solar system ’ kuiper belt . interestingly , larger disk seems gap twice pluto ’ average distance sun . could evidence third planet system .alma ’ image planetary disk around newborn star tw hydrae . reveals classic rings gaps signify planets formation system .close star , would difficult see smaller , inner planets . ’ ’ lost glare . addition , system quite dusty , making difficult spot planets . however , ’ possible jwst could study system search details disk . addition , esa ’ gaia space observatory could long-term measurements system find wobble star jupiter-mass planets tugging . atacama large millimeter array chile observed system , providing clear radio views protoplanetary disk around tw hydrae . future studies reveal details interesting newborn star developing planetary system .

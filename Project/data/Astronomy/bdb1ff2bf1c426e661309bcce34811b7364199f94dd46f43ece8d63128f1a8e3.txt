solar orbiter continues get closer sun , revealing passapril 10th , esa ’ solar orbiter made closest flyby sun , coming within 29 % distance earth sun . vantage point , spacecraft performing close-up studies sun inner heliosphere . basically uncharted territory , ’ never spacecraft close sun .one goals mission figure sun ’ corona — outer atmosphere — hot . corona reach temperatures 2 million degrees c , vastly hotter 5,500 c surface . new paper based solar orbiter data , may offer clues .last year , spacecraft returned data showing known phenomenon called magnetic reconnection taking place sun ’ surface . case , taking place extremely small scales , previously able seen .team ’ paper , published journal nature , explain magnetic reconnection occurs magnetic field changes stable configuration . fundamental energy release mechanism superheated gasses known plasmas . reconnections seen previously occurring large areas sun ’ surface known key mechanism involved causing solar flares eruptions .new research , combined data solar orbiter along nasa ’ solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) interface region imaging spectrograph ( iris ) missions , shows magnetic reconnection occurring smaller scales prime candidate mysterious heating sun ’ corona .“ taking advantage extreme-ultraviolet ( euv ) imaging data high-resolution coronal imager ( hi-c ) , ideally able resolve scales order 150 ? km , provided evidence reconnection braided magnetic threads corresponding heating , ” team wrote paper . said observations , took place march 2 , 2022 took place period one hour .esa press release , team said solar orbiter ’ ultra-high-resolution observations shows persistent small-scale ( around 390 km across ) reconnections take place corona . revealed long-lived ‘ gentle ’ sequence compared sudden explosive releases energy reconnection usually associated events like coronal mass ejections .researchers said temperatures around point magnetic field magnetic field intensity drops zero , known null-point , sustained around 10 million °c , generated outflow material came form discrete ‘ blobs ’ travelling away null point speed around 80 km/s .views various spacecraft showing observations solar magnetic reconnection event . top shows solar dynamics observatory ’ atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) full image sun , overlaid greyscale image sdo ’ helioseismic magnetic imager ( hmi ) area observed solar observatory ’ extreme ultraviolet imager ( eui . ) b displays fine structure observed event , noaa 12957. c zoom-in ) showing fan-like bright structure . zoom-in point-like brightening ( white box c ) indicating spatial scale heated plasma associated null reconnection.credit : x. cheng et al .addition continuous outflow , explosive episode also took place around null point , lasted four minutes .team said solar orbiter ’ results suggest magnetic reconnection , scales previously small resolved , proceeds continually gentle explosive ways . importantly means reconnection therefore persistently transfer mass energy overlying corona , contributing heating .solar orbiter mission continues , researchers said hope perform observations even higher spatio-temporal resolution future close approaches spacecraft estimate fraction corona ’ heat may transferred way .spacecraft 180 day-long orbit around sun , reaches closest approach sun every six months , around 42 million km ( 26 million miles ) sun .

dart surprising impact targetnasa ’ dart mission slammed asteroid dimorphous september 2022 , scientists determined impact caused tons rock ejected small asteroid ’ surface . importantly , dart ’ impact altered dimorphos ’ orbital period , decreasing 33 minutes .however , group researchers measured orbital period month later discovered increased 34 minutes — 1 minute longer first measurements . even though single impact dart , force continued slow asteroid ’ orbit , astronomers ’ yet know mechanism might .“ find mechanism previously presented system account large period change , drag impact ejecta unlikely explanation , ” researchers wrote paper , published preprint arxiv . “ observations ( 65803 ) didymos system needed confirm result understand system post impact . ”dart ’ purpose test asteroids respond impacts . first data following impact released , change orbital period great news , since type kinetic impact planetary defense technique , spacecraft intentionally collides potentially hazardous asteroid alter course . data dart helping nasa esa prepare possibility redirect asteroid away eventual impact earth .dart weighed 610 kg ( 1,340 lb ) crashed dimorphos approximately 22,530 km/h ( 14,000 mph . dart excavated crater dimorphos ’ surface ejected 900,000 kg ( 990 us tons ) debris space . data also indicated dart ’ impact dimorphos also changed trajectory moonlet ’ parent asteroid , didymos .scientists estimated dart ’ impact displaced one million kilograms ( two million pounds ) dusty rock space – enough fill six seven railroad cars . dart science team continuing analyze data , well new information composition asteroid moonlet characteristics ejecta learn much dart ’ initial hit moved asteroid , much came recoil .another group researchers , led taylor gudebski elisabeth heldridge , used 0.7m telescope thacher observatory located campus thacher school ventura county , california make observations .measured post-collision period change observations taken 20-30 days initial data , results indicate system period may shortened brief time .one thought since debris cloud large changed time , could influence dimorphos ’ orbit . study released march 2023 , astronomers tracked evolution debris cloud collision month found debris expanded outward , structures started forming , clumps , spirals long tail pushed away sun ’ radiation . gudebski heldridge ’ team ’ think debris would account change observed .james webb space telescopecaptured sequence dart collision dimorphos . credit : nasa , esa , csa , stsci .interestingly , researchers said , even dart collision , period dimorphos observed slowly changing . , researchers wrote , even amount change ’ account difference , “ 4 orders magnitude small account difference see . ”“ therefore , whatever effect causing orbital decay collision account discrepancy observe ; includes binary yorp effect , mutual tides , differential yarkovsky force , nodal precession , mass loss , ” said .group researchers dart team continue observe study dart ’ impact . interesting find orbital period continues decline , might affect use kinetic impactors .additionally , another spacecraft launch 2024 study dimorphos even closer . esa ’ hera mission arrive didymos dimorphos december 2026. hera undertake detailed study dimorphos understand deeply impact affected .

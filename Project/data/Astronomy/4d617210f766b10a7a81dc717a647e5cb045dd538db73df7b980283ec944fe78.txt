'' according merriam-websterearth 's clouds primarily made water , 'll find ground fog way altitudes 47 53 miles ( 76 85 km ) , 'll find rare noctilucent clouds . clouds , however , exist 43,000 feet ( 13,100 ) .earth , clouds responsible rain , caused water droplets clouds become heavy , fall back surface precipitation rain snow .clouds form ?formation clouds requires right combination ingredients conditions . always water earth 's atmosphere , 's presence water creates clouds .per noaa , water molecules need something attach order condense — objects cloud condensation nuclei . cloud condensation nuclei various things , wildfire smoke ocean spray windblown dirt , key must small , one micron ( one one-thousandth millimeter ) size hygroscopic ( attract water ) . water condenses nuclei , overall cloud droplet typically 100 times larger nuclei .temperature dew point also play role cloud formation . air must reach 100 percent relative humidity ( temperature dew point ) order condensation occur . air atmosphere always moving , criteria always changing , clouds appear disappear quickly .different types clouds ?global standard cloud classification world meteorological organization 's international cloud atlas , lists 10 main types clouds .sometimes 'll hear four main types clouds , 's referring classification established industrial chemist luke howard 1803 `` essay modifications clouds . '' howard actually named three main types — cirrus , cumulus , stratus — fourth special type called nimbus .international cloud atlas expands upon original classification system includes 10 cloud types .low-level cloudscumulonimbus : towering thunderstorm clouds spread top like anvilstratocumulus : gray white patchy sheet rolled rounded cloudsstratus : gray translucent cloud layeralso types clouds , 're special cases generally fall outside classification system . include lenticular clouds ( ones look like ufos mountains ) , mammatus clouds ( lumpy , dense clouds frequently associated cumulonimbus clouds ) , contrails ( condensation trails produced airplanes ) .planets clouds ?yes ! clouds exclusive earth . according university california , santa barbara , planets except mercury clouds — clouds contain traces water , usually form ice crystals . makes earth 's clouds stand 're made almost entirely water , whereas clouds planets typically comprise various gases .clouds neighboring planets vastly different compositions . jupiter , instance , clouds primarily made ammonia ice ammonium hydrosulfide whereas venus ' clouds made sulfuric acid .cloud types faqsfour main types clouds ?four main types clouds cumulus , cirrus , stratus , nimbus .many types clouds ?four main types clouds expanded 10 classifications wmo 's international cloud atlas . many special clouds beyond classifications .fluffy clouds called ?small , white fluffy clouds appear clusters cumulus clouds . large tower-like anvil-shaped fluffy clouds cumulonimbus clouds , also known thunderstorm clouds .cloud q & expertjames laduemeteorologistjames ladue acting director national windstorm impact reduction program ( nwirp ) engineering laboratory national institute standards technology ( nist ) ; member american meteorological society ( ams ) , american society civil engineers ( asce ) , national weather association ( nwa ) .asked meteorologist james ladue , acting director national windstorm impact reduction program ( nwirp ) engineering laboratory national institute standards technology ( nist ) , frequently asked questions clouds .many different types clouds ?fundamental question whose answer complex . take simple concept clouds form cooling air parcel 's temperature water vapor within condenses onto small particles ( dust , salt , biologicals ) exist everywhere create clouds water . add atmosphere cold enough water vapor deposits onto particles ice crystals instead liquid cloud drops . clouds ice crystals look quite different liquid drops n't disappear quickly mixed drier air . ice crystal clouds likely persist individual crystals slowly fall curtain-like veils get mares tails .among clouds , act cooling air sounds simple many ways perform act . night near ground , air cools quickly infrared radiation escapes space fog forms . warm air could travel cool surface thing happens . fog could turn low stratus . air n't rising quickly ; 's mostly traveling horizontally . fog low stratus flat uniform appearance . aloft air 's softly rising stable atmosphere create sheets uniform-looking clouds like stratus , altostratus , , case ice crystals , cirrostratus . looks different altitude whether 're liquid droplets ice crystals .add atmospheric buoyancy , like strong heating strong cooling aloft , air parcels may erupt quickly upwards downwards attempt stabilize atmosphere . well , goes flat uniform appearance comes cellular , cumuliform , appearance . heating starts ground , get fair weather clumpy cumulus clouds . since condensation ( deposition ice crystals ) occurs , act heats air cause buoyant parcels . get altocumulus cirrocumulus . enough buoyancy altocumulus becomes altocumulus castellanus — tall buoyant plumes flat stratiform bases — initial cloud form altostratus , heat condensation causes top clouds turn cumulus .rate temperature decrease atmosphere high deep enough , 's enough moisture really heat rising air parcel , cumulus turn cumulonimbus showers thunderstorms form . storms may form cumulus , altocumulus , may see buoyant parcels form altostratus . thunderstorms really effective spewing moisture upwards downwards , generates sorts mechanisms produce sorts cloud species . tops spread outwards form anvils thick cirrus clouds . thunderstorms spawn cold air spreads outwards forming cold fronts lift air along edges create shelf clouds ., n't even discussed clouds may consist stuff water !clouds white ( , cases , dark gray ) ?clouds white liquid ice droplets scatter sun 's rays different directions equally colors make white sunlight . catch scattered light reach eyes brightness incoming sunlight . eyes cloud 's thick enough absorb scattered light , brightness goes get gray clouds . note gray still means colors sunlight roughly equally absorbed .sometimes sunlight n't scatter light equally directions . thin stratus altostratus cloud similar-sized droplets scatters light mostly forward direction mechanism called mie scattering . sometimes 're airplane looking clouds , look grey despite small thin . somebody ground underneath cloud may see cloud appearing white ..clearly cloud density thickness affect much sunlight absorbed . thicker denser cloud , darker base becomes , like cumulonimbus cloud ( thunderstorm ) . clearly someone looking thunderstorm cumulonimbus side illuminated sun see bright cloud , liquid ice crystals effective reflecting light backward side .mentioned scattering , reflection , absorption . processes affect clouds appear . mie scattering n't change color light , direction preference certain clouds . reflection sunlight light bounced back larger surfaces , perhaps ice crystals raindrops . absorption incident light absorbed object converted heat , scattering reflection .effect clouds climate ?clouds keep us cooked alive . clouds atmosphere sunlight would scattered/reflected back space would heat intolerable levels ( everything else left ) . yay clouds !however , elevation clouds form types clouds affect cooling heating atmosphere . clouds scatter visible infrared light different levels . example , thin cirrus clouds n't absorb scatter sunlight efficiently appear translucent . sunlight gets surface . surface warms emits infrared light upward encounter cirrus clouds look opaque wavelength . cirrus cloud absorbs re-emits infrared light back ground heat trapped . cirrus clouds keep lower atmosphere warm .hand , liquid clouds cool lower atmosphere density efficiently reflects sunlight back space . course , clouds types trap infrared light lower atmosphere thus result warmth night , atmosphere liquid clouds cool quickly .research clouds help hinder global warming becoming clearer . latest research suggests 'll get higher cirrus clouds , effectively allows sunlight heat atmosphere trapping infrared ; positive enhancing warming . meanwhile , warming atmosphere reduces liquid cloud cover could reflect sunlight away .satellites helped understanding clouds ?crucial . polar-orbiting geostationary satellites provide continuous coverage clouds using sensors detect light multiple thermal infrared visible wavelengths . intensity light detected multiple wavelengths converted give us lot quantitative information global heat exchanges , level solar incoming light , outgoing terrestrial infrared light . helps climate scientists track heat balances clouds affect .meteorological side , satellites provide information understand atmospheric patterns develop clouds . observations clouds , meteorologists detect atmospheric processes create clouds . use clouds analyze atmospheric motion storm systems . observations assist , use clouds make forecasts future clouds attendant hazards . consider tropical storms : satellite era , numerous tropical storms went undetected came perilously close shore .

”illustration artemis astronauts moon . credits : nasacases , language attempt call forth spirit outer space treaty . however , many critics stated , artemis accords suffer fact tied specific space agency program . certainly basis rogozin russia ’ resistance accords first announced , hence russia china come together .short , decided establish set bilateral agreements would allow others participate program lunar exploration . ’ clear long-term implications , could possibly lead tensions territorial disputes road . , one hallmarks current era space exploration plurality , multiple space agencies ( commercial space ) involved instead two competing superpowers .three five major space powers create two competing frameworks ask others join , one forgiven concluding ’ new space race

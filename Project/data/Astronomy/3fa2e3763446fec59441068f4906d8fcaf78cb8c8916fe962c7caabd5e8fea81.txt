robot expandable appendages could explore martian caves cliffsplenty areas solar system interesting scientific purposes hard access traditional rovers . prominent caves cliffs mars – exposed strata could hold clues whether life ever existed red planet . far , none missions sent able explore difficult-to-reach places . mission concept team stanford hopes change .concept , known reachbot , robot support using multiple articulated appendages navigate terrain would difficult reach using navigational techniques . addition able traverse complex ground patterns , could also , theory , least scale sheer cliff faces .initially pitched nasa institute advanced concepts project , awarded phase grant back 2021. authors describe idea fusion two separate technologies developed different purposes : mobile manipulation robots deployable space structures .mobile manipulation robots relatively common space exploration . platforms like robonaut lemur utilize robotics technology perform tasks like maintaining iss inspecting space habitats—however , much mobility limited . efforts like lemur pride able navigate tricky terrain , even would difficulty scaling cliff face .deployable structures , hand , commonly used satellites . decrease space necessary pack things like solar panels antennas rocket fairing , deploying reach space . typically use kind thermal electrical smart material , lot ongoing research area .reachbot takes best worlds using deployable structure manipulated appendages . allows extend one appendages new position , secure place using end-effector adhere surface , reposition rotating joints .fraser explains could explore lava tubes moon mars .’ ever gone rock climbing , ’ heard adage “ three points contact. ” reachbot uses similar technique – moving one appendage time , maintain position setting move , albeit slowly , toward intended target .intended target could middle cliff middle cave , exciting areas sample collection . reachbot ascend cliff , simply extends one appendages past others , secures , pulls . alternatively , cave rough floor , suspend different features , including ceiling .addition , reachbot use appendages secure apply force surface . surface pressure critical operations like drilling made much difficult system ’ cross-brace .detailed report laid stanford team showed progress several areas , including coming controller , researching different end-effector solutions , coming mission architecture . also plenty plans future efforts , including testing prototype real-world environment similar one robot might encounter mars . , lab continuing development completion phase project . seems well placed phase ii , nothing come far . reachbots also plenty use cases terrestrial applications , somebody undoubtedly come along keep technology moving along development path .

dimorphos probably piece didymoslast september , nasa purposefully smashed spacecraft dimorphos , 160m-wide space rock orbiting larger asteroid named didymos . goal mission , called dart ( double asteroid redirection test ) , demonstrate humanity ’ ability redirect hazardous asteroids away earth . part mission success beyond expectations . scientists also learning origins two asteroids . study conducted wake dart impact found dimorphos made material didymos , pair asteroids likely originated single body .dart impact blasted significant cloud debris away dimorphos . initial cloud , made fine-grained dust gaseous material containing traces sodium potassium , quickly spread moved away system . dispersed within matter minutes . second cloud heavier debris , however , persisted months . using nasa ’ 3m irtf telescope hawaii , research team observed secondary debris cloud week following impact , watching evolved spread . found spectroscopic signature dimorphos debris matched pre-impact didymos .asteroids , words , made material : silicate ( compound silicon oxygen ) .dart impact , ~5 percent light system originated dimorphos . drastically outshined larger partner didymos , making incredibly difficult get distinct spectral observations tiny asteroid . however , impact , whole system brightened considerably , debris , maximum , contributed 64 % light reaching earth-based telescopes system . bright glow made possible study composition dimorphos ’ debris cloud .research team noticed debris made largely heavier material larger rocks , solar wind quickly pushed away smaller grains . appears contrast material surface didymos , researchers predict made mostly small grains – prediction upcoming european space agency ’ hera mission able confirm .didymos dimorphos made material , end separate asteroids ?leading theory called ‘ rotational-disruption ’ model :“ asteroids diameters smaller tens km disrupt fast rotation applies tension weak internal strength , resulting ejected material goes orbit eventually accumulates satellite , ” researchers explain .small , fast-spinning asteroid , didymos good candidate model . almost certainly ejected particulates orbit around . also shares geometry common among binary asteroids : spherical bulge around equator . geometry strengthens case rotational-disruption model .new data collected dart impact , case pretty well closed . fact spectral signature identical didymos dimorphos strongly suggests originated one body . time , fast-spinning asteroid spun material orbit , collected together form tiny moon called dimorphos . stayed eons , dart interrupted path , gave new orbit ( gave us unique opportunity study ) .

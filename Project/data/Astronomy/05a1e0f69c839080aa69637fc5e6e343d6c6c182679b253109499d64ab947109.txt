cylindrical autonomous drilling bot could reach buried martian watersouth pole mars likely candidate future exploration efforts . also area interest astrobiologists , decent chance might signs ancient water , therefore , signs ancient life – red planet anyway . access ancient life , explorers would get , means digging much ever dug mars . typical deep-bore drilling equipment bulky , heavy , difficult set remote terrain like martian south pole . group engineers planet enterprises , space technology incubator based washington , developed new deep bore drilling concept call borebots .nasa ’ institute advanced concepts niac ) support borebots concept back 2021 , engineers , led quinn morley tom bowen , produced mammoth 96-page report efforts . report details borebots unique world extraterrestrial drilling widely accepted concept numerous exploration contexts .context designed look underground water martian south pole . engineers estimated could collect interesting scientific data borehole measuring 50 .presentation borebots project mars society credit – mars society youtube channeltypically , borehole far , even earth , would require sort tether back surface . usually , would include cable rigid piping system would provide power control drill bit . means lot material , heavy , making costly space exploration .team planet enterprises came solution – make autonomous bots could drilling without tethered base station . bots look like pieces drilling tubing . still , autonomous robots self-contained battery , drill bit , motor , electronic system , contained cylindrical housing 64mm diameter 1.1 long .could deployed rover similar perseverance rover already trundling around mars . rover could extend deployment tube , bot would descend start busily drilling away surface . since remotely powered , primary constraint would battery life , using drill bit dig regolith power intensive . however , begins run low battery , simply engage series traction spikes side climb back hole dug .fraser describes hard land heavy things , like deep-bore mining equipment , red planet .borebot makes back deployment tube safely rover , shunted aside cleaning recharging station another one takes place . speed , borebot system could almost continuously dig without need heavy support equipment – set borebots keep hacking away rock .engineers thought plenty potential problems , including power dead borebot hole – could developed power . could one make branching bore something exciting particular area – employing articulated joint would allow next borebot proceed slight angle – hopefully mess climbing process borebots decide continue central hole .plenty interesting cad designs even 3d-printed devices described final report . ’ short math either – describing calculations power electronics torque necessary drill head . also mention expressed interest mars society flesh concept resource extraction , well idea potentially utilize idea ocean worlds ., ’ unclear project undertaking next step development . paper details clear plan increase technology readiness level , appear received funding niac , funding source . however , planet enterprises engineers ’ let get – titanair concept received niac phase award 2023. ’ plenty time keep working wildly innovative ideas .

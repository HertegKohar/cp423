multiple supernova remnants merging distant nebulakey astronomy careful observation . unlike many sciences , astronomers ’ often work lab . sure , build space telescopes large ground observatories , even tools simple sticks stones astronomers able change understanding universe patience observation . tradition still holds true today , recent study astronomical journal shows .study focuses small nebula southern hemisphere known 30 doradus b. part star-forming region creating stars 10 million years . first glance , 30 dor b rather typical nebula . ’ supernova remnant large magellanic cloud , otherwise much look . however , interesting things discovered take time look .case , team looked x-ray data captured chandra space telescope . two million seconds worth data , adds 23 days . weeks data , able detect faint shell gas emitting x-rays . shell 130 light-years across , large , unusual . x-ray shells often seen around supernova remnants . supernovae explode cast shell high-velocity material , collide interstellar gas produce x-rays .team went , looked hubble observations region visible light , observations infrared . combining data began see something strange . visible infrared observations show distribution gas nebula , combined x-ray data region could show supernova occurred 5,000 years ago . extended shell faint x-rays large match age . based size x-ray shell , must supernova explosion 5,000 years ago .taken together , observations revealed 30 doradus b simple supernova . instead , product least two supernovae occurring within region . ’ possible first supernova helped trigger second one . ’ even possible multiple supernovae occurred region past several millennia .course , none obvious look nebula . team astronomers ’ taken second look would assume typical remnant . detailed study , learn evolution demise large stars star-forming regions . careful observation leads beautiful data , understanding cosmos richer .

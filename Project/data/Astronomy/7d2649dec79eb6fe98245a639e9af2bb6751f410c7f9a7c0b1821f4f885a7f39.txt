meteorites made earth filled wateraccording widely accepted scientific theory , solar system formed nebula dust gas roughly 4.56 billion years ago ( aka . nebula theory ) . began nebula experienced gravitational collapse center , fusing material tremendous pressure create sun . time , remaining material fell extended disk around sun , gradually accreting form planetesimals grew larger time . planetesimals eventually experienced hydrostatic equilibrium , collapsing spherical bodies create earth companions .based modern observations simulations , researchers trying understand conditions like planetesimals formed . new study , geologists california institute technology ( caltech ) combined meteorite data thermodynamic modeling better understand went bodies earth inner planets formed . according results , earliest planetesimals formed presence water , inconsistent current astrophysical models early solar system .research conducted laboratory paul asimow , eleanor john r. mcmillan professor geology geochemistry caltech . team led assistant professor damanveer grewal , leader cosmogeo lab arizona state university ( asu ) former postdoctoral scholar division geological planetary sciences caltech . grewal asimow joined planetary scientists massachusetts institute technology ( mit ) , university california los angeles ( ucla ) , rice university .sample rare meteorite family revealing parent planetesimal layered structure molten core solid crust ( similar earth ) . credit : carl agee , institute meteoritics unm/mitgrewal colleagues specialize studying chemical signatures iron meteorites gather information early solar system . meteorites remnants metallic cores first planetesimals accrete form planet continue orbit within solar system today . many eons , objects fell earth ’ gravity well ultimately crashed surface . chemical composition meteorites particular interest since reveals great deal environments formed .one thing , composition planetesimals reveal whether ( earth ) formed closer farther away sun . former scenario case , cooler conditions would allowed earth retain water ice building block . latter correct , earth would formed dry obtained water means later , current astrophysical models suggest . according models , water delivered inner solar system via comets asteroids billions years ago , period known late heavy bombardment .water longer present meteorites , scientists infer existence presence elements . include iron oxide ( feo ) , occurs iron oxidization exposure water . sufficient excess water drive process , creating ferric oxide ( fe2o3 ) ferric oxyhydroxide , feo ( oh ) – ingredients rust . earliest planetesimals would lost traces iron oxide long ago , grewal team able determine much present examining metallic nickel , cobalt , iron contents meteorites .three elements present roughly equal ratios relative materials meteorite , means “ missing ” iron would depleted oxidation . asimow explained caltech news release :“ iron meteorites somewhat neglected planet-formation community , constitute rich stores information earliest period solar system history , work read signals . difference measured inner solar system meteorites expected implies oxygen activity 10,000 times higher . ”team ’ results indicate meteorites believed originated inner solar system roughly amount missing iron meteorites outer solar system . suggests groups formed part solar system conditions cool enough water . implies planets accreted water beginning , could profound implications theories life emerged earth . “ water present early building blocks planet , important elements like carbon nitrogen likely present well , ” said grewal . “ ingredients life may present seeds rocky planets right start . ”represents significant challenge current models solar system formed evolved , could indicate conditions early inner solar system much cooler previously thought . results could also mean earth fellow rocky planets formed farther sun gradually migrated current orbits . however , asimow acknowledged , degree uncertainty comes study ancient planetesimals , means results may contradict current astrophysical models :“ however , method detects water used oxidizing iron . sensitive excess water might go form ocean . , conclusions study consistent earth accretion models call late addition even water-rich material . ”

thirsty moon ? throw regolith microwavematter go universe , ’ going need water . thus far , human missions earth orbit moon taken water . works short missions , ’ practical long term . water heavy , would take far much fuel bring sufficient water sustain long-term bases moon mars . ’ use water extract locally .fortunately , water common molecule universe . even moon plenty water sustain lunar colony . real challenge extract . recent study shows , might easy popping things microwave oven .although water present tiny quantities moon , concentrated polar regions . pockets ice concentrated shadowed regions poles . consistency ice pockets similar snow mixed mostly dusty sand particles . imagine trying extract drinkable water material . tried heat stove , would dry ’ heat evenly . even successful melting ice , ’ end damp sludge .previous studies using simulated lunar material shown traditional conductive heating extract water , ’ particularly effective . takes lot power , making difficult scale enough sustain colony . study , team looked using microwaves extract water .fraction water extracted microwaves . credit : cole , et al’ ever reheated something microwave oven , know common problem sometimes hit miss . get hot regions icy regions side-by-side , like poorly cooked hot pocket , also heat things way slightly damp . ’ water molecules strongly excited microwaves oven cause shift material , usually toward surface . long-known microwave cooking extract water material . team wanted know could lunar material effectively .team focused two simulated lunar materials . one simulated lunar highlands ( lhs-1 ) one simulated lunar mare region ( lms-1 ) . looked efficiently water could extracted different percentages ice content . found using special microwave oven 250 watts , could extract 55 % 67 % water within half hour . practical enough extract plenty water polar regions , microwave technology used would easy build maintain moon . interestingly , method less effective get materials higher water content , traditional conductive heating effective .

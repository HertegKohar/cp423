breakup supercontinents may trigger explosive eruptions send fountains diamonds shooting earth 's surface .diamonds form deep earth 's crust , approximately 93 miles ( 150 kilometers ) . brought surface quickly eruptions called kimberlites . kimberlites travel 11 83 mph ( 18 133 km/h ) , eruptions may created mount vesuvius-like explosions gases dust , said thomas gernon , professor earth climate science university southampton england .researchers noticed kimberlites occur often times tectonic plates rearranging big ways , gernon said , breakup supercontinent pangaea . oddly , though , kimberlites often erupt middle continents , edges breakups — interior crust thick , tough hard disrupt .`` diamonds sat base continents hundreds millions even billions years , '' gernon said . `` must stimulus drives suddenly , eruptions really powerful , really explosive . ''gernon colleagues began looking correlations ages kimberlites degree plate fragmentation occurring times . found last 500 million years , pattern plates start pull apart , 22 million 30 million years later , kimberlite eruptions peak . ( pattern held last 1 billion years well uncertainty given difficulties tracing geologic cycles far back . )example , researchers found kimberlite eruptions picked africa south america starting 25 million years breakup southern supercontinent gondwana , 180 million years ago . today 's north america also saw spike kimberlites pangaea began rift apart around 250 million years ago . interestingly , kimberlite eruptions seemed start edges rifts marched steadily toward center land masses .figure driving patterns , researchers used multiple computer models deep crust upper mantle . found tectonic plates pull apart , base continental crust thins — crust top stretches forms valleys . hot rock rises , comes contact now-disrupted boundary , cools sinks , creating local areas circulation .unstable regions trigger instability neighboring regions , gradually migrating thousands miles toward center continent . finding matches real-life pattern seen kimberlite eruptions starting near rift zones moving continental interiors , researchers reported july 26 journal nature .instabilities cause explosive eruptions deep crust ? 's mixing right materials , gernon said . instabilities enough allow rock upper mantle lower crust flow .churns together rock lots water carbon dioxide trapped within , along many key kimberlite minerals — including diamonds . result like shaking bottle champagne , gernon said : eruptions lot explosive potential buoyancy drive surface .findings could useful searching undiscovered diamond deposits , gernon said . might also help explain types volcanic eruptions sometimes occur long supercontinent breakup regions largely stable .`` ’ fundamental highly organized physical process , '' gernon said , `` 's likely kimberlites responding , could whole array earth system processes responding well .

'' frozen coolant known limit mission lifetime . october 2010 , spacecraft depleted coolant primary mission ended .two infrared detectors could n't work anymore , still two others could operate even without coolant . wise began new mission called neowise post-cryogenic mission , looked near-earth comets asteroids . continued work placed hibernation february 2011 .finding 20 new comets , 33,000 asteroids belt mars jupiter , 134 neos .neowise caught comet c/2013 uq4 ( catalina ) 's high activity reaching closest point orbit sun 2013 .

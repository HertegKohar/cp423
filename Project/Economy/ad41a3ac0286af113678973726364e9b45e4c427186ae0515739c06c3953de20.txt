So far this year markets have endured a slew of hurdles-from inflation worries, to rising rates, and now recent turmoil in the banking sector. Despite the wild ride, there are still names that may be worth a look according to Jonathan Boyar, President of Boyar Research. Boyar noted excitement over Topgolf Callaway Brands (MODG) as a viable stock pick. He noted the company buying 86% of Topgolf it didn't already own, makes the stock “a growth story at a value price…about 50% of their EBITA in 2023 will be Topgolf, and there's lots of room for expansion." Overall, Boyar said his picks are “outside the mainstream because I think that's the way investors will be able to make money over the next 3-5 years" For more of Jonathan Boyar’s stock picks watch the full interview here with Yahoo Finance’s Rachelle Akuffo.

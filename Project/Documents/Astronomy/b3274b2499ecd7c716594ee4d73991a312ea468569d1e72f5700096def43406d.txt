credit : nasa’ long road , looks though spacex may finally ready orbital flight test starship super heavy . months waiting , static fire tests , stacking , restacking , elon musk announced march 16th spacex could ready go sn24 bn7 prototypes “ weeks , ” pending approval federal aviation administration ( faa ) . musk announced via twitter , saying , “ launch timing depends faa license approval . assuming takes weeks , first launch attempt near end third week april , aka… ”china national space agency ( cnsa ) made considerable progress recent years development long march 5 ( cz-5 ) rocket completion tiangong-3 space station . agency also turned heads announced plans june 2021 create international lunar research station ( ilrs ) would rival artemis program . top , china upped ante announced later month also plans send crewed missions mars 2033 , concurrent nasa ’ plans .part growing efforts become major power space , includes human exploration , china recently announced completion first in-orbit test stirling thermoelectric converter . shenzou-15 mission crew performed test aboard tiangong-3 , first successful verification technology space . technology also investigated nasa considered technological solution challenges space exploration , especially long-duration stays missions locations deep space concerned .one intriguing aspects cosmos , james webb space telescope ( jwst ) allowed astronomers explore , phenomenon known gravitational lenses . einstein ’ theory general relativity describes , curvature spacetime altered presence massive objects gravity . effect leads objects space ( like galaxies galaxy clusters ) altering path light travels distant objects ( amplifying well ) . taking advantage technique known gravitational lensing , astronomers study distant objects greater detail .consider image , esa ’ picture month acquired james webb space telescope ( jwst ) . image shows vast gravitational lens caused sdss j1226+2149 , galaxy cluster located roughly 6.3 billion light-years earth constellation coma berenices . lens galaxies created greatly amplified light distant cosmic seahorse galaxy . combined webb ‘ incredible sensitivity , technique allowed astronomers study cosmic seahorse hopes learning star formation early galaxies .1931 , indian-american physicist subrahmanyan chandrasekhar proposed resolution einstein ’ theory general relativity postulated existence black holes . 1972 , astronomers obtained first conclusive evidence objects existed universe . observations quasars center milky way also revealed massive galaxies supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) cores . since , study black holes revealed objects vary size mass , ranging micro black holes ( mbhs ) intermediate black holes ( imbhs ) smbhs .using astronomical simulations technique known gravitational lensing , international team astrophysicists detected could largest black hole ever observed . ultramassive black hole ( umbh ) mass roughly 30 billion times sun located near center abell 1201 galaxy cluster , roughly 2.7 billion light-years earth . first time black hole found using gravitational lensing , could enable studies look farther space find black holes deepen understanding size scale .soyuz ms-22 crew ship pictured docked rassvet module . background , prichal docking module attached nauka multipurpose laboratory module

space . december 14th , 2022 , february 11th , 2023 , two space capsules reportedly suffered radiator coolant leaks ( soyuz ms-22 progress 82 ) . addition delivering fresh supplies international space station ( iss ) , one spacecraft ( m-22 ) slated bring three members expedition 68 back earth .luckily , february 25th , russia announced sending another soyuz capsule replace m-22 ( soyuz m-23 ) retrieve three crew members , cosmonauts sergey prokopyev dmitri petelin , astronaut frank rubio ( return earth september 27th ) . addition , tuesday , march 28th , russia undocked m-22 iss successfully brought home without crew . nasa provided live coverage undocking departure uncrewed spacecraft via nasa tv , agency website , nasa app .according new report , nasa could launch orbital-only mission mars 2033. credits : nasacoming decade , nasa china plan send first crewed missions ( astronauts taikonauts ) mars . agencies hope begin sending missions 2033 , coinciding mars opposition , followed additional missions 2035 , 2037 , . missions culminate creation mars surface habitat enable future missions research . launch opportunities missions limited distances earth mars vary considerably time , ranging 56 million km ( ~35 million mi ) 400 million km ( 250 million mi ) .times earth mars closest ( known mars opposition ) occur every 26 months . moreover , using conventional propulsion methods , takes missions six nine months travel earth mars . result , round-trip missions mars could take three years , dramatically increasing radiation exposure crew time spend microgravity . according recent study nasa ’ jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) , 2033 unique opportunity send crewed orbital mission mars lasts 1.6 years .artist ’ impression fast radio burst traveling space reaching earth . credit : eso/m . kornmesserfast radio bursts ( frbs ) first detected 2007 ( lorimer burst ) remained one mysterious astronomical phenomena ever since . bright radio pulses generally last milliseconds never heard ( except rare case repeating frbs ) . gravitational waves ( gw ) , phenomenon predicted general relativity first detected september 14th , 2015. together , two phenomena led revolution astronomy events detected regularly provide fresh insight cosmic mysteries .new study led australian research council centre excellence gravitational wave discovery ( ozgrav ) , australian-american team researchers revealed frbs gws may connected . according study , recently appeared journal nature astronomy , team noted potential coincidence binary neutron star merger bright non-repeating frb . confirmed , results could confirm astronomers expected time – frbs caused variety astronomical events .visualization ilrs , cnsa guide partnership ( june 2021 ) . credit : cnsajune 2021 , china announced partnering russia launch lunar exploration program would rival nasa ’ artemis program . program would include robotic landers , orbiters , crewed missions would culminate creation outpost around moon ’ southern polar region – international lunar research station ( ilrs ) . details still scant , periodic updates provided “ big-picture ” idea lunar outpost look like .case point , recent national space conference , team scientists chinese academy sciences ( cas ) presented list objectives ilrs . according china science daily , objectives include moon-based astronomy , earth observation , lunar in-situ resource utilization ( isru ) . addition , cas scientists indicated china plans establish basic model lunar research station based two planned exploration missions 2028 , subsequently expand international base .november 2024 , nasa ’ artemis ii mission launch cape canaveral , carrying crew four astronauts around moon returning home . first crewed mission program , paving way artemis iii long-awaited return moon 2025. missions rely orion spacecraft space launch system ( sls ) super-heavy launch vehicle . nasa ’ michoud assembly facility new orleans , teams engineers finished integrating five major structures make core stage artemis ii rocket .artist 's conception potentially-habitable exomoon . credit : nasalooking signs life beyond solar system , astrobiologists confined looking life understand . part , means looking rocky planets orbit within star ’ circumsolar habitable zone ( hz ) , distance liquid water exist surface . coming years , next-generation telescopes instruments allow astronomers characterize exoplanet atmospheres like never . happens , look chemical signatures associate life , like nitrogen , oxygen , carbon dioxide , methane , ammonia .however , astrobiologists theorized life could exist outer solar system beneath surfaces icy moons like europa , callisto , titan , “ ocean worlds. ” , shortage astrobiologists think search extraterrestrial life include exomoons , including orbit free-floating planets ( ffps ) . recent study , researchers led max planck institute extraterrestrial physics (

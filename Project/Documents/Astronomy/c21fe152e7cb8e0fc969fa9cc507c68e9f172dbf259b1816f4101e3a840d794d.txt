( image credit : nasa tv )james webb space telescope spotted earliest known galaxy ever `` quenched '' — suddenly mysteriously halting star formation — scientists think supermassive black hole center could blame .galaxy , called gs-9209 , formed stars hyperactive burst activity 600 million 800 million years big bang . , 12.5 billion years ago , suddenly stopped . researchers published discovery jan. 26 preprint server arxiv ( opens new tab ) , yet peer-reviewed .`` thing 's particularly surprising soon big bang galaxy shut star formation . local universe , massive galaxies shut think slow process billions years , '' lead author adam carnall ( opens new tab ) , astrophysicist royal observatory edinburgh , scotland , told live science . `` go back early times , 's enough time slow quenching process happen , 's old . long time thought would n't find sorts things .

''following burst activity , researchers think gs-9209 abruptly shut supermassive black hole lurking heart . black holes born collapse giant stars grow ceaselessly gorging gas , dust , stars black holes . black hole gs-9209 's center likely grew large enough become quasar . quasars giant black holes enormous quantity material circling maws , heats enough push gas clouds away blasts light trillion times luminous brightest stars .`` massive black hole stuff falling , leads lot energy radiating accretion , '' carnall said . `` basically process think capable injecting enough energy galaxy 's gas short space time either heat n't collapse form anymore stars , completely clear galaxy star-forming gas .

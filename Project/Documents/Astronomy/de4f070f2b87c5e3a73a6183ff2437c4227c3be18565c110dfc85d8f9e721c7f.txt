powerful jet streaming active galactic black hole devouring huge amounts matter . ( image credit : nasa/jpl-caltech )first time , astronomers spotted jet blasting core distant galaxy changed directions .one percent supermassive black holes , reside center galaxies , disks gas dust swirling around . debris disk ventures toward growing black holes blasts powerful jets light-like speeds random directions . jets push massive amounts energy nearby areas help shape galaxies eons , one ways astronomers classify galaxies based jets oriented .example , galaxy cores jets charged particles beaming perpendicularly seen earth , called quasars . sometimes , jets aimed directly earth , galaxy cores called blazars . astronomers know quasars blazars exist , latest finding first time observed galaxy former group transform latter .finding comes distant galaxy named pbc j2333.9-2343 , whose core blasted jets past long gone quiet . latest research , astronomers found core stirred jets back life , one `` drastically '' changed directions . galaxy , spans four million light-years located 656 million light-years away earth , shines strongly radio wavelengths thus called radio galaxy . given sharp change jet 's orientation , astronomers redefined giant radio galaxy one blazar center .`` started study galaxy showed peculiar properties , '' lorena hernández-garcía , astronomer millenium institute astrophysics chile study 's lead author , said statement ( opens new tab ) . `` hypothesis relativistic jet supermassive black hole changed direction , confirm idea carry lot observations . ''hernández-garcía 's team studied galaxy across entire electromagnetic spectrum — including radio , optical , infrared , x-ray , ultraviolet wavelengths , found one jets perpendicular line sight changed direction 90 degrees faces earth . `` exceptional case jet reorientation '' warranted redefining galaxy , astronomers say .galaxies classified based orientation jets , change directions well understood . astronomers speculate mergers galaxies black holes contribute intermittent bursts jet activity , directions jets change bursts .activity surprising , since astronomers already know bright rare x-shaped galaxies , whose notable x-shape arises similar erratic behavior jets , behave similarly . team behind latest study suspects pbc j2333.9-2343 galaxy x-shaped : `` see x-shape , explained new jets , chance , pointing towards us , '' authors write study .research described paper ( opens new tab ) published march 20 journal monthly notices royal astronomical society .sharmila seattle-based science journalist . found love astronomy carl sagan 's pale blue dot hooked ever since . holds journalism northeastern university contributing writer astronomy magazine since 2017. follow twitter @ sharmilakg .
